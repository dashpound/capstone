# Get Git

Git is the technology behind tools like GitHub.
GitHub is an awesome tool for version control & collaborative coding projects.  I would highly encourage its use for this project.


Github can be used a number of ways, but the most effective (in my opinion) is to use it as a remote reposistory that is accessed via the command line. 

For windows users installing git bash is the best way to go to use git.  In my experience, every version of linux I've used has git already installed and can be accessed from the command line.  Not sure about Macs.
