They HAVE to be the best in their class....about $600 the pair.....but typical planars....small imaging.....4 ohm power hungry.....sound slightly strained.....4 or 5 Feet out from the wall.....but still....I wanted more.I bought a set of ElectroMotion ESLs from Amazon. I power them with a 35 YO Receiver, the NAD 7175. It is so good, it is scary accurate.If you buy a Small stereo system, it sounds like you have a small sound coming out of a small box......If you buy Better tower Speakers.....it might sound like you are setting at a concert on the 50th row of a 100 row theater.If you buy some very, very good box speakers.....it might move you down to the first rows......And it might not.But if you buy really well made and balanced ElectroStatics, like these MartinLogans....the artists are in your living room.You can hear them breathing.......Some say the Bass is thin. Don't believe them. Unless you are a devotee of \"Ace of Bass\" music....the bass is Full and accurate.They are going to break in and get better........ :)These are fabulous speakers.BEST in class."}

But I didn't and both me and my wife weer pleasantly amazed at the ease of use and high quality pictures we got immediately. I suspect people play with the settings and especially the high iso one and end of with less resolution for low light which may not be needed anyway. The auto function works extemely well as it select the best scene, focus and shutter. All our initial pictures were just perfect, even under less than idea conditions. For my book I give it an overall 4.5, and that is just because the camera is still new and still learning the full features, I would recommencd it as others have. None were blurred."}

{"reviewerID":"AEL8SXIP0GNYU","reviewText":"The sound quality of this unit is phenomenal.  We have a Bose SoundDock II as well and there is really no comparison.  The HK sounds very noticeably MUCH better.  You will not need \"golden ears\" to hear the difference.  The sound of the HK, as many others have noted, is rich, full and clear, with a surprising degree of quality sound in the lower frequencies (tight, punchy bass).  Got this one for my wife to take to her office and, if she ever actually does that, I'll probably end up buying another one."}

The adjustment controls work great and the unit locks down solid after installation & adjustment. To be ultra picky, I would prefer a projector specific mounting plate instead of the infinitely adjustable arms. I'm told they make them but haven't been able to locate one for my application. Not that it would work any better, I'd just prefer the \"custom\" approach instead of the \"universal\" that's all. In any event you won't be disappointed with this purchase."}

{"reviewerID":"AWF6W5KZJBF9E","reviewText":"I found this keyboard case to be very flexible and well thought out. I own two other cases from another manufacturer and in comparing found the Airbender equal to or superior.Pros: The case design is well thought out, very functional and lightweight. I travel frequently for work and this case would be a great companion to my travel gear. The hard cover offers a good mix of protection and minimal weight added for travel, the swivel mechanism allows for easy adjustment and swapping from tablet to laptop mode. It also adds minimal thickness or bulk to your iPad.The keyboard is very nice to type on, with good stroke and a very efficient use of keyboard layout. In comparing to the other guys the better layout along with additional function keys (lock, highlighted cut\/copy\/paste, home, lock etc.) makes it the clear winner. My other keyboards bury useful functions like the tab on a letter key, making typing inefficient or clumsy. Not with the Airbender Air!Another feature I particularly liked was the upper shell that the iPad air actually mounts into. There is a nice protective lip all the way around it. This affords protection for the ipad and makes for a secure mount. I noticed some reviews of this unit mentioned difficulty removing the unit. I did not find this to be an issue. The brief instruction sheet that comes in the box has clear and easy to follow instruction on how to do that. Lastly the fact that it covers the whole ipad, makes this a better design. One of my other keyboards (a well known brand that cost nearly 4X the Airbender) has broken twice and can no longer be trusted to hold my iPad. They&#8217;d do well to copy NEWTRENT&#8217;s design. Lightweight is great as long as it can be relied on. I prefer security.The unit is shipped with a nice long micro usb cable. Lots of manufacturers skimp here but not NEWTRENT. I have not had the unit long enough to gauge the battery life, but with modern lithium technology and NEWTRENT&#8217;s experience with batteries I am betting that&#8217;s not an issue.Overall the unit looks very premium, was packaged well and has caught lots of peoples attention while I travel. At a price of $29.95 it is an astounding deal. Just buy it, you won&#8217;t regret it.Cons: No product is perfect, but again at this price point and quality one or two minor issues are negligible. I&#8217;d like a backlit keyboard and another color option (white), but I would imagine this would likely raise the price and cause a hit in battery life.Ratings:Value for price 5 ***** (but I&#8217;d give it a 6 if possible)Functionality 5 *****Ease of Use 5 *****Overall 5 *****"}

The mounting bracket worked great and should work for most other TVs that have 2 holes in the back to mount the vertical bars to.  Once attached to the TV, you simply mount the wall bracket with the built in level (LOVE IT), and then hang your TV on the bracket.  It is very low profile, and a cinch to set up.  All of the pieces come in a bag with each one clearly labeled.  And the best part is that the price was very low.  Highly recommend!"}

Then, I saw a rash of blog posts praising the new Echo pens and had to try it.I am terrible about writing this down in a regular notebook and then never looking at it again. Either that, or it takes forever for me to flip through hundreds of pages looking for something. I recently decided I needed to do something about that so I started using Evernote and Things to become more productive. Still, I was missing something.When I first received the pen, I was one of the unlucky ones who had the dreaded \"Upgrade the pen software\" error when trying to use the included dot paper. I talked with support and found out that there was a firmware issue that affected some people. Drat. This didn't seem to be off to a good start.Fortunately, within a couple days, the new firmware was posted and I was able to get started. So far, no issues at all. I use Mac OS X and the software works great.My only gripe is the lack of functionality to convert handwritten notes to text. You need to purchase a 3rd party application for that for an extra $30. If that feature was included, I would rate the pen 5 stars in a heartbeat.Now that I have this, the rest falls on me to do the rest. So far, so good. Part of my post-meeting workflow now is to copy the images into Evernote and add my tasks to Things. So long abandoned papers!UPDATE: Didn't realize the notes to text software was included.

{"reviewerID":"A3NXH2PFO8SMC8","reviewText":"I wish Logitech would get some decent Mac programmers. Honestly. I've used a number of keyboard\/mouse combinations over the years from them because they make the nicest feeling peripherals in the price range, but their Mac support sucks. They install a crappy control panel, make you restart, settings don't stick between reboots and half the time the peripherals aren't recognized by the software.Take this KB\/mouse combo, for example. I downloaded latest Logitech Control Center this morning (3.3.0) and I'm running OS X 10.6.4. I installed and restarted and the keyboard still isn't recognized by the software so I can configure it properly. The most basic thing they could have possibly done - remapping the cmd and option keys so they are in the right places - doesn't even get done. And there's no way to change it in the settings. As I've said, I've used many Logitech keyboards in the past so I usually just remap them manually using the Keyboard pref pane. That *doesn't work with this device* because of the newfangled USB Unity thing. I can't remap the keys at all. Worse, trying to remap them kills the mouse button mappings (switching the CMD and option keys in the Keyboard pref pane also does it for the custom mappings on the mouse). I don't know who's fault this is - Apple's or Logitech's - but I don't care. The KB\/mouse is nigh on unusable in OS X.The only reason it gets 3 stars is because it works well in Windows. Stay away if you primarily use OS X."}

The adapter fits perfectly into a slot in the back of the TV which was obviously made for the physical characteristics of this apdater. Within 5 minutes of plugging it in, it had synched with my home wireless router, and was up and running. My adapter is on the other side of the house, and I experienced no performance issues. My recommendation, if your Sony TV owner's manual specifies this adapter, buy it. All I can figure is that the people complaining are technically challenged, did not have a Sony TV, or would have issues plugging in a microwave oven."}

{"reviewerID":"ANCIWXTLRK2XJ","reviewText":"I bought a $200 surveillance camera that connected to my VCR several years ago, I always wanted something that connected to my laptop to allow me to record in digital format. This was my dream come true.  Plus it's remote viewing AND you can control the position of the camera. I LOVE IT!I've only had it for a couple weeks but it's been great. Let me preface that I haven't tried to use it past my cable modem, i.e. outside my local router. That's a cool feature as well, but not what I need.I pulled it out of the box, connected it to my router, installed software and BAM! I had access to the camera.  Then I configured for wireless and put the camera in the front window and had remote control. It was very easy. If you can set up a router, you can set up this camera (at least for local viewing).I've been recording my property for the past two weeks and I love it. How nice not to have to use a VCR to review video.I have a question however, is there a way to schedule recording aside from motion detection or alarms?  This is my only issue to date. I'd like to be able to record while I'm away and schedule it. I can always use some macro that clicks on record, then clicks off record and schedule that on my computer.There were a few issues setting it up, namely it didn't initially say what the admin password was in the manual which it later revealed. Also, I hide the SSID on my router and I had to give that up to use this camera. I wasn't happy about that, but at least it's password protected.Also, the IR night vision is amazing, but you really can't use it through a window which is what I wanted.Overall 5 stars. For $80 this made me very happy. Just what I wanted. I may get another for the backyard!  Good quality so far.WARNING: If you have an older router, I had a Cisco wireless-G router, this camera will mess up your router. When I turned on the camera and then turned on my computer, the computer would not recognize the router. I replaced the router with a new wireless-N and it works like a charm now."}

The factories in China that make this also make changes to the chipsets without making model number changes and use the general UG802 designation for it, making it very easy to mess up the device when you root or flash it due to improper chipsets in it.

No, it doesn't have a remote, but this speaker was not meant to sit on a pedestal on one end of your 100 ft. loft with you on the other end in a recliner.

{"reviewerID":"A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","reviewText":"On paper, this laptop has a lot going for it - a 3rd generation Ivy Bridge i5 dual core processor, 6 GB RAM, a 15.6\" multi touch screen, a 5GHz wifi adapter (Atheros AR5BWB222), 3 USB ports (1 USB 3.0), 5 hour battery life (as per the product specs - in reality this is about half that), and a modern design aesthetic.Unfortunately, the more I used it, the more I ran into its limitations, and hence my 3 star (It's Okay) rating.1. Performance.Its Windows Experience Index numbers (on a scale of 1 to 7.9) are:Processor (6.9), Memory (7.1), Graphics 4.5, Gaming (6.2), Hard disk (5.9)The V5 is really hurt by its anemic Intel HD Graphics 4000 chip (only 128MB of dedicated video memory); as well as by its 5400 RPM hard drive.2. ConstructionThis is a handsome laptop, but its cut corners soon become apparent with use - it feels plastic-ky and less well finished than my other laptops.3. Usability - TouchpadThe touchpad is located too far to the left making left clicks a challenge, has a stiff click action, and tends to lose sensitivity when performing click-drag operations (when closing Modern\/Metro apps, touch pad drags were often ignored.)It supports Win8 actions such as invoking the Charm menu, but these were easy to trigger inadvertently yanking me out of my thoughts.4. Usability - KeyboardThe keyboard is firm, full sized, and backlit. However, some keys are simply too small, and the Caps\/Num Lock keys provide no indication when active.5. Usability - Touch screenThe touch screen is the perfect complement to Windows 8's Modern\/Metro interface, and is natural to use. However, right click and click drag actions were harder to pull off, and I kept resorting to the mouse.Reaching across the keyboard can be an uncomfortable action depending on user position.Touching the screen can also be sacrilegious for those sensitive to screen smudges :)6. ScreenThe display was sufficiently bright, with adequate color reproduction. Its 1366x768 resolution is measly for a 15.6\" screen, but has the benefit of making text easier to read and icons easier to click - since each pixel is larger.7. No built-in Ethernet\/VGA portsIn a tragic design decision, these ports are only available using a separate adapter cable. That means I not only have to pack this itty bitty connector each time, but I also have to worry that I will misplace it :(8. Battery life - even with light use, the battery ran down in 3 hours. This is too short for mobile use.9. Integrated Optical Drive - a nice touch, but as expected at this price point, Bluray is not supported.10. SoftwareThis unit was surprisingly clear of bloatware (except for NTI Media Maker). Even the trial Windows Office 2010 is a download link. Unfortunately, Acer was just as sparing with useful software.Who is this for?###########This laptop seems to be aimed at users with light to moderate usage needs - it should be adequate for Internet browsing\/streaming, general home use, and for school homework. The larger pixels at this resolution and screen size should also be easier on older eyes.However, gamers, road warriors, developers, and other power users will likely be better served elsewhere.Conclusion#######While this may seem to be a lot of laptop for the money, I found that there were some material compromises.How satisfied you will be with this laptop will depend on which of these compromises matter to you.Happy Computing!"}
{"reviewerID":"A1DMVNB3A02CL6","reviewText":"If you're looking for a Linux dial-up modem, this is the one to get.  It's truly a hardware modem and uses the USB communications device standard.  Linux detects the device using the standard USB communication driver and it woks with \"pppd\" and KDE KPPP.If you're looking for a Windows modem this is still a great modem but you can get less expensive software modems.  One advantage for Windows users is the bundled BVRP Phone Tools fax, terminal and phone book software.  I've used this software with other US Robotics modems and it works great on all versions of Windows from Windows 2000 through Windows 7.  Please be aware that it only works with the US Robotics modem and not other modems you may have installed.  Since the modem is a true hardware modem it won't use as much of the computer's processing to communicate over dial-up.  It's also less likely to cause operating system problems and crashes since it doesn't use a special OS service or driver.The modem is light, small and well constructed.  It comes with a decently long phone cord including a ferrite donut to cut down on radio interference.  It works fine with any phone cable but the phone cable may affect nearby radio devices without the ferrite donut.  I haven't had any problems with any phone cord.There is a small green power light and a small phone communication light to show what the modem is doing.  I thought those were a nice feature since I could tell immediately when the OS detected the modem (the power light came on).  I also could tell when the modem was communicating because the data light would blink.As I mentioned the software included is BVRP Classic Phone Tools for Windows.  It has a CD with drivers and software, including a \"README\" file for Linux users.  If you're having trouble figuring out the Linux device name, look at the Linux README on the CD.A printed manual is included, but it doesn't have a lot of information.  There's just enough to get the modem installed and working so you need to read the Phone Tools documentation.  The printed manual is in multiple languages and that makes it seem like it has more than it actually does.It may not be obvious but this modem also can send and receive faxes.  The Phone Tools software for Windows has a fax capture driver that will let nearly any program print a document to the fax.  Phone Tools gives you a chance to add a cover page and review the document before you send it.  My only complaint about the print to fax driver is that you have to print all the pages using the same program.  You can't add more pages to a fax after creating it.  I've had to resort to pasting multiple pages into word documents or merging Acrobat documents so that I can make everything into one fax.  Considering what the software does for the price it's a great program.The modem does get warm after a while but not even enough to be uncomfortable to hold in your hand.  I haven't had any problems with long-term operation and it communicates as fast as the phone line quality allows.  The best part is that it doesn't have any noticeable effect on the speed of the computer and doesn't require any special software.My only complaint about the modem is the price, but it isn't exorbitant compared to other true hardware modems for PCI or PCMCIA.  Since it uses USB it is much more compatible with any computer, from a desktop to a netbook.  Almost everything has a USB port and most operating systems support the USB communications device standard.  Even though it's not cheap this modem will be useful for a long time, even with the inevitable computer technology changes.  A PCMCIA or Expresscard modem might not be compatible with older or newer laptops and is no more convenient to plug in and use.For Linux, you only need to buy one of these modems and connect it to whatever computer you happen to be using.  Linux HAL detects it and you can use it immediately after plugging it in.  You don't have to reboot or type in shell commands.  If you're hesitating about the price, consider that it will save you time on every Linux computer where you need to use dial-up.  The software modems included with most computers (especially laptops) are hard to get working and may stop working when you install newer versions of Linux.  Also the software modem drivers tend to require undesirable kernel options such as no preemption in order to work.  You have none of those issues with this little modem because it uses no extra software on Linux.The bottom line is that this modem is worth every penny in spite of the rather high price.  Amazon super-saver shipping takes a bit of the sting out of the price."}

For a front radiator, the hard drive bays will need to be modified and cut to fit a dual rad. I replaced all the 140mm fans (5 total) with Xigmatek crystal series red LED and removed the side mesh for a custom window to optimize airflow and improve the look. For now the dual 230mm top fans are the only stock fans installed. In some areas, the metal isn't finished well and can have a cheap feel and appearance. If you can get this on sale, then go for it. Otherwise, pass and find a case better designed. For the front radiator, the HDD cage will need to be removed, but a 5.25 cage in the top for HDD's will compensate for this. However, tons of room for any installing anything you want."}

However my itouch gets scratches, glares in the sun, and is sometimes hard to glide the finger across the glass screen, dampens my experience with my itouch. Using power support anti-glare film for itouch 2g has provided me exactly what I needed. A screen protector that protects from scratches, enables one to see the screen without glares from the sun, and a smooth gliding.Easy to apply, just thoroughly clean the itouch screen, then use the pre-application(the white paper) and apply it onto the screen, and remove. This removes all dust or any remaining particles that is not removed by thoroughly cleaning it. Then take out the 1 of the 2(yes 2) screen protectors, and apply it onto the itouch screen. Be careful not to touch the adhesive part of it, and be careful when you are about to place it down as it attracts to the screen. After you apply it, simply use the cloth that came with the itouch, or a lint free cloth to remove any air bubbles formed. It is to your best advantage you do not use it until one day has passed because it will allow the screen protector to fully attach it, and any remaining air bubbles you could not remove will be gone(My opinion that you should wait one day, you do not need to do this.)I have bought this on 09\/23\/2009, and today's date is 10\/24\/2009, one month and one day. The screen protector is still intact, there are no scratches still, it is still easy for me to glide my finger across, there are no air bubbles, I am still able to see the screen under the sun, and it still remains the best screen protector I have used."}

Being a techie dad i gave them a thorough testing and i really like design choices that were made in the construction. one problem that always seems to pop up with headphones in general is that the connections break and you get a lot of crackling or music popping in and out or only working on one ear.

{"reviewerID":"A2HSCJ5XN882NJ","reviewText":"Short story: with another 3' cable, will not charge phone fast, results in a slow charge.I bought these along with a 3ft Male to Micro USB 2.0 AmazonBasics cable.  The idea was to charge my phone with them.  My micro connectors tend to break\/wear out so I thought an extension would work well.  (aka just buy the smaller cable to replace rather than the long cable)The two combined when plugged into my stock Moto X wall plug is a slow charge. If I take the smaller 3ft cable and plug it directly into the charger I get a fast charge.I've done some reading online and the consensus is that the extension cables are NOT GOOD for charging.  The act of extending (connecting the two cables) introduces resistance to the line and thus they slow the power that can flow to the device.I would have been smarter to buy two 12ft cables from another well known cable website for the same money.  I could have bought  2x the cables even if not extension cables, I could have bought 2x the cables and just worn through them."}

{"reviewerID":"A1NADKSHMF3S6K","reviewText":"I bought this friction mount for my Nuvi 350, and used both on a recent driving vacation.  Both worked even better than expected!Amazon's listings are a little confusing--If you have a Nuvi, don't buy the one that says \"for Garmin GPS\".  Get this one instead.  With this one, you don't need to purchase anything else, just use the little bracket that comes with the Nuvi unit.  (Put the bracket onto the mount without the GPS in it--it takes some pressure or a little twisting to get the bracket to snap onto the ball of the mount.  But once it's on, you won't need to take the bracket off the mount.  The GPS snaps into and out of the bracket easily--the bracket and mount stay together as one piece.)The literature with the GPS unit said that the dash mount adhesive is hard to remove, so I didn't want that on my car's dash.  Some reviews said the windshield mount could melt to the glass and I didn't want that, either.  Also, some say that thieves will break into your car even if they can only see the windshield mount, assuming the GPS is in the car somewhere.  So, I wanted the friction mount.  It was about $28 at amazon.After using it, I like it even better than I thought I would.  It holds VERY well; I never had a problem with it slipping even once.  It's easy to reposition, for example if the sun is hitting it the wrong way, and it's easy to put into the console when you park so that nothing shows to tempt theives.  Also, it can just stay plugged in to the car's power outlet.  The cord plugs into the bracket on the mount instead of directly into the Nuvi, which is convenient.  The Nuvi unit itself easily releases from the mount, with no cords to unplug, and is easy to take with you.The only disadvantages I can come up with are that it is a separate purchase (but is complete), and it's not beautiful (but neither are the other mounts, I guess).If you can't or don't want to use the windshield or permanent dash mounts, try this one.  I'm glad I bought it.A suggestion to amazon would be to describe all these mounts & other accessories a little better--lots of postings say they bought the wrong mount or bought accessories that were already included with the GPS unit, because they were listed on the product page with the GPS unit.By the way, I love the Nuvi 350!"}

{"reviewerID":"A3JZNR4U0L9HTK","reviewText":"If you are a somewhat frequent phone dropper, or your work necessitates your phone be well protected, I can't imagine a much better case than the Commuter.  It offers a nice balance between not being obscenely big, while at the same time, it's two part construction offers great protection.The inner silicone wraps around the phone first.  Its function is twofold: first, because it's what is in immediate contact with your phone, it's nice that it's soft, protecting from scuffs and scratches.  Secondly, when the case is completely assembled, it offers a fair degree of \"shock-absorption\" for falls from reasonable heights.  There are nicely fitted high quality rubber plugs for the USB and headphone jacks.  Button overlays for the power and volume rocker are easy to depress, and have a nice tactile \"click\" to them when everything is all assembled.The outer shell is a hard plastic which is mostly smooth, but does have a very subtle texture on the back.  Overall, it has a very nice feel to it.  It requires a bit of gentle maneuvering to get it to fit correctly over the silicone inner piece, but once on, everything fits nice and snugly.  Very nice fit and finish.  The cutouts are all very precise.  This is a very high-quality case.The main drawback is that there is a fair amount of bulk added to the phone with this case, making it difficult for me to carry in all situations.  Getting the phone in and out of dress pants or jeans pockets when it's in this case can be somewhat challenging.  Also, as others have mentioned, the inner silicone layer is a lint and dust magnet.  After having this case on my phone 24-7 for about a month, I ended up switching for a lower profile case which was more suited to my every day use.  I still turn to the Otterbox in certain situations, as the protection it provides is certainly second to none.A final word about the extended battery:The case will not fit correctly with the extended battery in the phone.  To me, having the extended battery was a must, so I looked into how I could have the best of both worlds.  There are a couple of ways around this.  1) You could put the phone in the case without the battery cover on, or 2) you could modify the standard battery cover so that it can accomodate the extended battery using a dremel tool (several guides on the internet if you Google it).  I opted for option #2, and with some careful dremeling, I was able to use the extended battery with the standard battery cover, and the phone perfectly fit in the Otterbox Commuter."}

I looked for solutions online, and came across this, checked out the reviews, and purchased it.The actual issue was that some channels, particularly in the HD offerings were just not tuning in. This solved most of the issues (by no fault of the device, according to the internal sensors it raised it as much as stated, the signal just really sucks). Not a big deal for me, but you do have to supply your own coaxial connection between the power brick and amplifier. The other thing to note is that it is warm to the touch, so you want to be careful where you put it, as blocking the air flow around it can cause it to get hot.The only other thing that can be a bit annoying is trying to manage the arrangement of the connections, but that is going to be so dependent on the placement of your outlet and incoming signal, I don't feel right judging it."}

{"reviewerID":"A2F4A55ENQBQ6U","reviewText":"I was completely surprised at how easy this set up was, and at first while reading the instructions I started to overthink it.  Don't.  One person can do this from point A & then B.  My house was built in 2003, I am in central eastern Florida, and with the main modem (docsys 3) getting just over 40mbps I tested my connection on the other end of this setup and it's getting the same.  And that's at the opposite end of the house.  I originally bought a signal booster by them but it didn't like my provider's modem for some reason so I returned it and went with these, and I'm glad I did.  My Netgear N900 wireless adapter for my laptop is great, and this powerline adapter is as well.  So far they're batting 1000 with me.  The utility from the Netgear support site is neat, and a quick download.  Not needed, but nice to have and will help keep you informed about available support software updates."}

{"reviewerID":"A106JMRSLCPDSV","reviewText":"Finally, a keypad with a TAB key! If you are looking for a good quality keypad that truly allows you to enter data with one hand, I highly recommend this product. The keys are over-sized, which makes it easy for folks with big fingers to operate. The keys have a nice, springy action to them that give good tactile feedback. In fact, it feels more like the keyboard of a high quality desk calculator than your run-of-the-mill keypad. I would have given it five stars, but one of the rubber feet is missing from the bottom. This does not affect the performance of the keypad at all.I bought this keypad because I was specifically looking for one with a TAB key. As the manager of a bowling association, one of my tasks is to enter scores for bowlers from award sheets into the bowling program. They computer provided by the association does not have a numeric keypad, but I happened to have one from another computer. It was better than nothing, but when entering the scores, I would have to hit the TAB key on the main keyboard. This slowed me down considerably. This new keypad now allows me to enter the scores one-handed and has definitely sped up the entering of the scores. If you have to do a lot of numerical entry, you can't go wrong with this keypad -- even if your existing keyboard has one built in."}

{"reviewerID":"A1CSRR7FCKBL9M","reviewText":"I bought this to, well, look at the sun without going blind. Of course packaging was good and the item was not damaged. It is just a slip on friction fit for my SkyQuest XT8. There is no obvious way to tell if it is on all the way but if you measure it out, you will get used to it. Make sure it is on all the way; it would be very painful to have it fall off while observing. I also do not feel the plastic thumb screws are effective. Tightening them feels like they will be easy to strip out. After mounting it, I went to check out the sun. It is actually a little hard to find ironically, since you can't (well, shouldn't) use a reflex sight. It shows up as a pretty boring yellow\/orange ball. You can see some sunspots which is cool for a few minutes then it gets a little old. As another reviewer mentioned, this would be great for an eclipse though. They also do not include any type of protective case\/sleeve so keep that in mind when ordering. Honestly, I would recommend you borrow this from a friend before buying."}

{"reviewerID":"A1BT6TL7UCIC5Y","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting much from this headset considering other bluetooth headsets I have used suffered from a background hissing noise when listening to music.  I'm pleased to say that these headphones don't suffer from a hiss.I'm impressed by the sound produced by these headphones.  The music sounds crisp.  These headphones are even good for classical music.Pairing it with my Nokia N9 was easy.  The phone instantly recognized the headphones and I only had to click \"connect\" within my phone interface to get the devices paired.Battery life is OK.  I estimate they power lasts about 5 hours, solely listening to music.I can also skip songs, change the volume, and pause the music from the little controls on the wire.  The device speaks in your ear to indicate when the device is turned on, turned off, or if the battery is running low.  The battery warning startles me since all of a sudden, a female voice starts speaking in my ear.  I think a little beep would have been a better warning.  On the other hand, the power on\/off alerts are useful.The fit of the headphones is OK, but I wouldn't jog or run with them on as they would likely fall out.  The buds are larger than others I have used and it took awhile to get used to the way they fit.Despite my quibbles, I think these headphones are an excellent choice if you're looking to get rid of the wire from your phone to the headphones.  My high rating is based on the great sound quality of these headphones in comparison to other bluetooth headphones."}

It's nice that you can put the receiver into the mouse for storage and it also serves as an off switch but for those of us who rarely travel it's not so convenient to have to unplug the USB receiver each time you power down just to save battery life. I wish it had a normal on off switch or an idle timer to power down after inactivity.The best feature for me is that it's not too big and not too small. It fits my palm well and has a nice responsive feel."}
{"reviewerID":"AAOPCU3MVKYRN","reviewText":"Like many others, I purchased these headphones for a ridiculously low price via Groupon. My headphones arrived after about three weeks and while they looked fine, they simply didn't work. The noise canceling didn't appear to do much of anything. If anything, it made noise louder! The headphones provided more noise isolation when the noise canceling feature was turned off. In addition every time one of the end-plates fell of the right earphone, which was frequently, the headphones emitted ear-destroying noise at maximum volume!Sadly, Able Planet has some of the worst customer service it has been my misfortune to encounter. If I'd had ANY idea of how bad it was, I would NEVER have done business with the company! Getting an RMA so my defective headphones could be exchanged was a three week process that involved numerous e-mails, web forms, and phone calls. Once I returned the headphones, it took Able Planet THREE months to furnish a replacement!The replacement headphones work as well as they ever will and they're thoroughly disappointing. Without batteries installed and the noise-canceling circuitry on, the headphones are muddy to the point of being useless. With the active circuitry engaged the sound is adequate at best; about what you'd expect from a $30-40 headphone not something that costs this much. Most of the noise cancellation seems to take place in the lower octaves. They're probably great at blocking out the constant low-pitched hum you hear while on an airplane. If you're looking to dampen the discussions happening in the cubicle next to you, the construction sound from across the street, or your own horrible singing you'll need to look elsewhere: there's some minimal attenuation in these frequency ranges, but not enough to be useful.Ultimately, I find that there's nothing to recommend these headphones. They don't stand out for sound quality, comfort, or noise cancellation and certainly not for customer service. Mine will end up at the bottom of a landfill before too long, I'm sure..."}

{"reviewerID":"A3NEAETOSXDBOM","reviewText":"Sometimes when you travel there is no USB port on a laptop or AC outlet on a wall that is available to power your electronic devices when their battery charges start running low. This product is perfect for those situations. It is nice and compact, and comes with multiple adaptors to power and\/or recharge a wide variety of electronic products. The included adaptors provide a backup for my iPod Touch 2G, iPod Nano 2G, Samsung cell phone, bluetooth headset, Garmin Forerunner 305, and Garmin Nuvi 660.Additional adaptors for other gadgets(such as for the Amazon Kindle) are available at a modest price.Here are a few comments to keep in mind:1. You can charge only one item at a time. Therefore when you reach your destination and have access to an AC outlet, if you wish to charge multiple items simultaneously, this is not the item to do that (I recommend the Callpod, which I have reviewed on Amazon). [But see my April 24, 2010 update below. I figured out a way to do it and no longer use the Callpod.]2. If you have a USB AC adaptor that you use for your iPod Touch or Nano, it will work fine to charge this unit. There is no need to buy a separate adaptor.3. Once the unit is fully charged, you can just leave it plugged in to the charging source (I checked with Tekkeon tech support, which is very helpful and responds quickly). That way you can be sure that the unit will always have a full charge when you need it.4. This unit will not power a laptop or comparable electronic product. But Tekkeon does sell more powerful (and more expensive) units that will do so.5. I chose this unit rather than the less expensive MP 1550, which runs on AA or rechargeable batteries, because in my experience I have found that a power source with its own internal battery lasts longer than one relying on batteries. Of course, the flip side is that once this unit runs out of power, you can't just pop some fresh batteries in. However, that is not an issue for me, though something that you may want to consider.This product looks nice, is simple to operate, and does what it says. I am very happy with it.Update August 22, 2009: I like this so much that I use it at home on a daily basis. The unit has two USB ports--a mini and a regular. Using the included retractable cable, I plug one end into the mini on the unit and the other end (which has a regular USB) into an Apple travel charger that is plugged into the wall. That way this unit is always at full charge if I take it on a trip. I use the free regular USB port on the unit to charge a variety of devices (though one at a time) that come with a USB cable, such as my BlackBerry and iPod Touch [But see April 24 update below re how to charge more than one at a time]. It is more convenient for me to charge them on this unit than to plug them into my laptop (which I do only when I need to sync data).I have also found the built in flashlight on this unit a nice feature to have when rummaging through my bags looking for some gizmo that I can't find.Update November 24, 2009: I recently stayed in a very nice hotel where the bedroom was really dark at night, but there was no nightlight in the bathroom. Solution: I just turned the flashlight on this unit on all night (8 hours)in the bathroom. Not only did the light last through the night, but it took only a relatively short time (less than 20 minutes) to restore the unit to a full charge.Update April 16, 2010: Customer service for this company is first rate. On a recent trip I realized that I did not have a micro USB tip that would fit my BlackBerry Tour and Kindle 2. I emailed customer service after I returned home, and was advised that this tip was supposed to be included with the product. But since I bought my unit over a year ago, it was not included then. When I explained the situation to Jerry at customer service, he mailed me the tip at no cost within 24 hours. It's always nice to know that a quality product comes with quality customer service.Update April 24, 2010: If you would like to use this product to simultaneously power more than one USB device at a time, there is an easy way to do it. I use the Belkin mini USB 2.0 hub (which I have reviewed on Amazon) and plug it into this unit, and now have four USB ports for my gadgets. The more gadgets you plug in, the faster you will drain the unit. But it is handy, for example, on a longer plane ride or at the beach for my wife and me to each plug our Slacker G2 players into the hub, which is in turn connected to the MP 1800, in order to extend the playing time. I also use the same technique for my Kindle 2, BlackBerry Tour, iPod Touch, and Garmin Forerunner 405CX.Also, when you arrive at your destination, just connect this unit to an AC adaptor as I described in an earlier comment above, connect the hub to this unit, and now with AC power you can simultaneously not only recharge this unit, but also recharge up to four USB devices--all without a computer or bringing along the separate USB adaptors for each device (though being a \"belts & suspenders\" kind of guy, I still bring them along just in case for some reason the hub should fail since \"Murphy's law\"--if something can go wrong, it will go wrong--has kicked in on more than one vacation). Note: What I have described only works with the type of relatively low power draw USB devices that I have mentioned above. Also if you are drawing too much power for all the devices connected, the light will flash on the Belkin mini hub and\/or on the Tekkeon MP1800. If that happens, just disconnect one or more devices until the flashing stops.Update September 11, 2011: Due to Hurricane Irene, the area in which we live was flooded and my wife and I were trapped in the house for 24 hours until the flood waters receded. We lost all power, and to my dismay the corded land line phone had gone dead. That left me with only my BlackBerry to communicate with friends and family.Power was not restored until four days later, but in the interim I had to return home during the day to supervise flood restoration crews and other persons. Each night I charged the Tekkeon at our friends' house, and brought it with me to my home during the day so I could keep my BlackBerry charged to make and receive calls and email. It worked like a champ.Bottom line: In emergency conditions, this unit proved critical and performed flawlessly.Update July 24, 2012: The unit recently \"died.\" When I plug it in to charge, the green light goes on and the flashlight works, but the second I disconnect it from the USB charging source, the green light goes off and nothing works. Customer service said it could be a defective switch, but I am well beyond the one year warranty period. However, I may continue to bring this as a nightlight when I travel since the flashlight will work so long as the unit is connected to a power source.Update August 7, 2012: I now use the Powergen mobile juice pack 5200, which I have reviewed on Amazon, and like it even better than this unit."}

There is a magnetic flap which holds the case closed, but does not function to cause the mini to go to sleep as some magnetic cases do. This magnetic flap also holds the front cover behind the device if you open it all the way for viewing in portrait mode, or just to hold the flap itself out of the way when using the case as a multi-angle stand in landscape mode.

{"reviewerID":"A3RUQO10JKY9NT","reviewText":"BACKGROUNDI recently purchased a new MacBook Air from Apple. As must of you know, products from Apple come at a premium and I wanted something to protect the top portion of my laptop as I worked. I previously purchased theBookArcby Twelvesouth as well as theirBackPackand was impressed by products and deeded to give their SurfacePad a chance.PACKAGE AND APPLICATIONThe SurfacePad arrives adhered to a piece of thick cardboard. The instructions on how to apply to the MacBook Air are printed on the backside along with tabs to help aid in separation of SurfacePad from the cardboard. Yes, for those wondering, the SurfacePad stays in place due to an adhesive. The great thing, though, is the adhesive does not leave a residue on the notebook once removed.APPEARANCEThe black of the SurfacePad as well as the print on the edges help it to blend in naturally with the MacBook Air and its black keyboard. It looks like it naturally belongs. It is also a very thin piece of leather and so it barely raises off the surface of the notebook during use.USEAGEThe SufacePad is comfortable during use. It is not raised on the notebook and is flat therefore I can rest my wrists on it perfectly while typing. Unfortunately, I did notice a big problem. There are several multi finger swipe commands that start off to the side of the trackpad with movement onto the trackpad. With the SurfacePad in place, these finger-swipes will not register and so these movements will not work.PROS:++ Perfect fit for the Macbook Air++ Blends in aesthetically with the rest of the MacBook Air++ Protects the aluminum casing from scratches & dirt from extensive useCONS:++ Many of Apples new finger swipe motions require you to use the side of your laptop surrounding the trackpad. This cover prevents those finger swipe motions from being preformedCONCLUSIONThis item does have a premium over similar products but that premium is displayed in the durability of the product. It protects your laptop, aesthetically  is pleasing, and is comfortable in use. Recommended overall."}

{"reviewerID":"A8WXLST0944GZ","reviewText":"Having the extra \"head-room\" for the extra storage space of 16GB will surely come in handy.The obvious big advantage here is the write speed on sequential shots.

On this card, the buffer is almost not noticeable.When I'm doing sports photography, that will probably come in handy.

Unlike most other bluetooth keyboards that will work with Android tablets, this keyboard has the special characters and functions that are also available on the Android touch screen. It works fine with any Android tablet. the keyboard is sturdy, thin, light-weight and the same width as the 10 inch tablet. Charges on mini USB while attached to the tablet or dock. it comes with a USB cable, but no charger. Power switch is located underneath the keyboard. device pairs easily and maintains connection. key operation is smooth. no sticking. device is top quality compared to other bluetooth kybds. I use it with the Toshiba Thrive 10\/32gb while docked in the Toshiba HDMI stand, or in the Toshiba portfolio flip case. A bluetooth mouse from another mfg completes the kit."}

{"reviewerID":"A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1","reviewText":"The Arctic 4500 home charger is a four-port USB charger for mobile devices well worth purchasing...but with some design choices that keep it from being a true five star product.The pros:-4 available charging ports with 4000mAh total output.-2 of the ports are fast charge ports for tablets (so, if you have a shiny new Kindle Fire HD but passed on the aftermarket charger: this will decrease your charging time).-LED charging status indicators (see the CONs below).The cons:-USB ports are placed on the short side edge of this charger.. For easy access to the USB ports, you'll have to mount this in the top plug of standard vertical 2-plug outlet. Not a problem, unless you wanted to use that plug for something else (which I do in the place where I am most likely to use this charger). While you could plug it into the bottom outlet, this will then remove the top outlet from use. This design choice should have been considered.-The LED flashing sequence indicating variations in charging load\/power output are indicated by the speed of flashing, and are not intuitive.As a charger: five stars, but less one star for design choices that limit its flexibility around already crowded outlets.Note: This item was provided for review purposes."}

{"reviewerID":"A1KRJAC8Z6AV7X","reviewText":"I have been using my N800 for a week now.  I have to say it is an amazing device.  I will add this right away, if you have vision issues you might not have as much fun using this, or other, devices of this size and resolution.  Reason being they are packing 800x480 pixels in a small screen size.  That means the pixels are smaller so characters will be in proportion smaller.  Yes, when using the browser you can \"zoom\" the display so that's nice but it can make a web page\/site very difficult to use.  I do not think of this as a short coming but rather just a fact of life for all small display's with high pixel density.  Just divide the number of pixels by the dimension of the display and then do the same for a larger display but with the same number of pixels and you see why the characters must be very teeny is some cases.  So, that past is just a heads-up for those who might not be aware of the issue and it really only applies to web browsing.  The font on the system itself are quite easy to read.I am going to be reading eBooks on the N800 and I can say that FBReader (pretty much the only ebook reader for the device or Linux for that matter) is an OUTSTANDING program and is very flexible allowing almost unlimited font sizing.  This make all the difference in terms of the above issue.  If you have visions probs and want tread ebooks on this device you can by simply setting a larger font size as well as background color.  But remember the software does not support any sort of DRM'd books.  If you want to read DRM'd books a good Palm based device (Sony Clie nx73v if you can find one or a Palm Tx) or a Kindle would be my suggestions.Next the absolute first you must configure the wireless so you can immediately upgrade to OS2008 before you do anything with the tablet.  Reason being is the can be compatibility issues between OS2007 apps and OS2008.  But it's painless and takes no more then 15-20mins.After that is done, it's time to poke and prod the system.  You will notice, no PDA functionality really.  And the built-in email app, well, it is marginal on it's best day.  You will need to look and depend on 3rd party apps for almost everything you use your PDA for.  And given the personality of Linux developers they are more interested in playing games and writing yet-another-audio-player type applications then they are using this powerful device for anything truly useful in terms of data.My biggest complaint with these devices is the lack of modular mobile broadband capability.  You cannot run a USB EVDO or HSDPA modem via the USB port because it can only operate in quasi-host mode called by Nokia On-The-Go.  That is because it only supplies about 100mV of current to the port for devices.  I understand it's a battery life issue.  Still the lack of ability to add a mobile broadband device severely limits where and when you can use your INTERNET tablet.  Odds are you did not buy this for home use...you bought it to be, well MOBILE.  But given the unpredictable nature of wifi hotspots it's harder to be mobile if there are not connectivity options.My work around for mobile connectivity was to buy a Cradlepoint CTR-350 USB Mobile Broadband Router that supports (as of firmware v2.x) both EVDO RevA as well as HSDPA USB modems.  Now this is NOT a self powered travel router but that is OK.  there is always the Cradlepoint PHS300 with a built-in battery if you prefer.  I opt'ed for a portable power solution using a Tekkeon MP1550 and eight (8) Ultra Low Discharge Sanyo Eneloop 2000mA AA batteries to use in the MP1550.  The MP1550 uses four AA batteries at a time.  With this setup I'll get a good 4-8 hrs of use of the router using the Franklin CDU680 EVDO Modem and EVDO service I have through Millenicom (better deal than via Sprint but over Sprint's EVDO system).  Plus this is a very light weight solution.  The other option I looked at was the Tekkeon myPower 3300.  A bit heavier but LOTS more power.  Still might go that router later on.I also bought three extra batteries for the N800.  I can now use it around 10-18hrs depending on wifi use.But you can see how the lack of a reasonable way to use mobile broadband in the N8x0 family of devices is an issue of you really want to be mobile.  But because it has a STRONG wifi set with excellent range and sensitivity, it's possible to create yourself as your own mobile hotspot.  I will carry the router\/modem\/power pack in a Tom Bihn Buzz bag because that is convenient for me.  But any carry bag will work.  Even a batman Utility belt... ;)So, anyway, I have been everywhere with the device and love it a lot.  There are not many applications for it yet...but such is the nature of things.  In order to get any sort of reasonable word processing you will need to run a different OS like KDE or some other port to the N8x0 devices.  But I am feeling this is just for now and will change soon enough.And do not expect video streaming to be all that great.  It is a very immature product line in that aspect.  It's basically a roll of the dice if you will ever see support for streaming of your fav video format.  And NSV will likely never happen.  You can stream lots of audio formats though.  Even Shoutcast using Streamtuner.It's new and the developers seem enamored with nothing but \"yet-another-audio-player\" type applications.  Real productivity applications are pretty much non-existent.  But you can use Google Docs so at least there is that, if you have an available Wifi internet connection that is...Oh, also if like to do crosswords on your PDA\/Handheld now...ummm, there are currently NO crossword puzzle applications which run on the N8x0 Maemo OS systems.  I am able to run my crossword application via the Garnet VM (Palm OS emulator for the Nokia Internet Tablets) so I can at least use it for that, sort of.  But I will not be getting rid of my Clie nx73 anytime soon because of this issue.Last there is no Java support yet.  There has been no port of a Java Runtime Module by either IBM or Sun.  That is a BIG hole in the potential for the N8x0 family of device.  So, if your application needs Java, it's gonna be a while, if ever.  I consider this a significant shortcoming as it should have been ready right and even part of the OS.Overall, it's an amazing and POWERFUL system with a lot of potential.  The display is amazing and vibrant.  Lots of storage potential with two SD (or SDHC) slots and the like.  But, I am not confident real professional grade applications will ever appear for the device in time.  So you will have to depend on web based applications like Google Docs to get any work done on the go.  And if you do want to do a lot of typing consider adding the iGo Stowaway Bluetooth folding keyboard.  It beats the heck out of the on screen keyboard and even the slide out for the N810.So, that is my long winded review.  I have to say I love the device it works well enough in the area's I need once I added the mobile broadband work around.  Now I have real internet access on a decent screen pretty much anywhere we roam without the need to lug around a laptop and at a fraction of the cost of a UMPC.  And just enough functionality, barely, out of the box to get things done.EDIT:There is now a GREAT freeware crossword puzzle program for the N8x0 series tablets.  The program is called Xword and is actually in the Maemo\/OS2008 repository.  So crossword puzzle fans can solve their daily NYT puzzles on the N8x0 series tablets.  Or any AcrossLite (.puz fromat) puzzles for that matter!!!"}
{"reviewerID":"A3HRLD5V6KCBKW","reviewText":"All of the past reviews gave me a pretty good idea of what to expect from this product, namely a low budget security system with average video quality. It does suffer from washed out colors and it may be difficult to positively ID someone but is sufficient to identify motion and that someone has entered the premises. It does have many configuration settings to satisfy most scenarios.There were two main unacceptable gotchas that I wasn't able to foresee:1. The web interface settings can only be accessed by installing an ActiveX plugin. This means you can only use Internet Explorer to see live video and access the DVR settings. Another review I read suggests that they do not provide an API (so that you can program somethihg yourself to see live video) and questions to the fact were not addressed in a postive manner by the manufacturer. Other cameras I've seen do not require the installation of a plug-in or if they do, offer you a choice to use a Java plugin which may be more accepted across browsers. The most secure method of viewing your DVR remotely is to VPN into your home network and hit the camera IP on your local network. This is not possible given what I mentioned above unless you are using Internet Explorer as your browser.2. You can set a schedule of when you want the DVR to record if it detects motion. However, if you want an email notification when motion is detected, you cannot schedule when you want it to do this...so you can only turn this feature on or off. It would make more sense if the email notification adheres to the schedule set for when the DVR records when it detects motion.Just to add, the motion detection email notification consists of a single image compared to my old Loftek camera which included 6 images in its email notification."}

Some of the prices that are advertised on Amazon for cases are ridiculous, so this fits the bill. The color a simple black, I haven't seen this case offered in any other color. Fitting the tablet in the case is very simple. The case doesn't hinder any hand movements or gestures, so you have full access to the screen.  The rubber material is lightweight and thin, no unneeded weight or size. Since it does wrap the face of the tablet, you can lay the tablet face down without too many issues.Some would say that the case is not a tight enough of a fit, I will disagree. I feel the case fits snug enough without being difficult to remove for cleaning. If you pick and pull at the case then it will not stay to the molding of the case and not fit properly. Cleaning can be accomplished by washing in warm soapy water, rinse off then dry completely. There is a slight odor associated with the rubber, but really not noticeable. I mean who goes around smelling their case all day?All of the ports are completely accessible. Power and volume cover buttons push in easy without any extra effort. Camera and light sensor are exposed nicely. Speaker port on the case is a little bigger than the tablet speaker opening, which I feel helps the sound projection from being choked down. Even the docking pins are exposed.All in all a great tablet case for the Nexus 7 2012.I RECOMMEND THIS CASE TO EVERYONE, 100%"}

The brackets that connect your TV to the mount are flimsy. Trying to center my TV bent those way too easily. Hopefully they fix that in the future. A nice lady from Cheetah mounts contacted me. She was very concerned about my comments on the mount, and asked me a few questions about it. I answered them, and she was able to \"rectify\" the situation. I spent more time than I should have installing this mount, and had to do some things to make it work in my situation. Let's just say, I'm satisfied with how Cheetah Mounts handled this. Their costumer service is much better than most others I have experienced. I will buy from them again. The best I can give is 3*s, and it's mostly for the customer service, had to -2* for the flimsy mount.*Original Review:Significantly not as pictured. The arms that hold the tv to the mount are not as pictured. They are much thinner, and have many \"cheetah\" holes in them. They bend extremely easy while trying to center your tv. The levels that come with the mount are almost worthless. The \"built in level\" is no longer built in, and you are not able to place it in the center of the mount due to its horrible new design. Luckily I have a 4' level, and that's how I was able to get this mount on the wall properly. The mount itself gets 1*, I added another * for the hdmi cord. I have 2 other cheetah mounts in my house, and they are great, but I can not recommend this one. I'm more than likely going to replace it with a higher quality mount because I do not have much faith in this one. It says it can hold 165lbs, I have a 60\" Sharp Aquos that weighs maybe 65lbs, and I don't trust it."}

{"reviewerID":"A3KF79AODCE7YE","reviewText":"I am not a music buff and I am not an expert on sounds, but as an average Joe, I enjoy and appreciate good audio from my headphones. And this Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone delivers it!1. THE SOUND: The audio quality is excellent. The enclosed headphone captures the all types of sound very well. I was able to hear all the background vocals, instruments, noises, and subtleties with ease. The digital sound is crisp and clear. Immensely enjoyable.2. THE WIRELESS: When it comes to the wireless capacity, each user might have different experience since it depends on your home. I live in ~1900 square feet (2 floors, attached garage) home. I was able hear the sound WHILE moving around the house (everywhere) without any drop in the sound. So when I was doing chores in the house (moving around floor to floor), I was able to enjoy the music without any drops. HOWEVER, when I was outside of the house, the sound was fine ONLY when I was still, but when I walked around outside of the house, the sound dropped frequently. If you want to use it outside, then you need to move the transmitter (and the music device) outside of your home and connect it to the outside outlet.3. THE HEADPHONE: It is comfortable, adjustable, but bit heavy (it has 2 AAA rechargeable batteries  - 1 on each side). So you need to get used to it. It has power, volume, dynamic bass boost, and 3D surround buttons on the right side of the headphone - which are small buttons, but great option. Since it covers your ears, it may cause you to sweat a little if you move around.4. THE TRANSMITTER: The transmitter comes with many options (power plug accessories for international usage) and cables for different electronic devices (TV, iPod, CD & Radio Player, etc). There is NO battery option for the transmitter. It needs to be plugged to the outlet all the time to be used. Also, the transmitter is used as rechargeable station for your headphone (the headphone has 2 AAA rechargeable battery on each side), which is an excellent idea. Also note that when you use the headphone - you MUST power on the transmitter AND the headphone each time you use it. There is no auto-power on.Overall, I LOVE this product - yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is a quality built and can be used with many electronic devices in the home. My wife loves it, when I go to bed she puts the wireless headphone on and watches TV from the bed - enjoying its undisturbed sound without disturbing me!  Highly recommended!"}

All I needed are included in this one magnificent light unit plus Windows 7 is the best OS so far.  You don't have to spend that much for a good laptop try this and you will never regret it... you'll even have extra cash for a wireless all-in-one printer."}

{"reviewerID":"AE88D7OM7YU99","reviewText":"My company recently moved me into an area that could not get noisier.  I would have better luck getting work done at a Kid Rock concert.  Actually, that is what I was doing.  Blasting my music to drowned out all the constant chatter.When I was in the electronic engineering field we had offices. When the door was closed that meant you were in a meeting or deep into your work. Unless it was an emergency, rarely was there a knock. You'd get a polite email asking for you to let them know when you were free.Not so in the software industry.  Now we are all in cube farms with constant racket and chatter.  I got these in hopes that the noise cancellation would allow me to keep the music volume down.  No luck.  The noise cancelation increases the volume a little but does nothing to drowned out the external noises.I know over the ear noise cancellation works best, but wearing glasses does not allow me to use those.The biggest negative though is these things can only be worn for a short time.  The buds are attached to a big plastic knob that pushes against your outer ear canal.  After an hour or two your ear starts hurting.  If you force yourself to continue wearing them after that, you end of with a soar ear the rest of the night.Over all I recommend going with a different brand unless you have really big outer ear canals and don't really mind that the noise cancellation does not work."}
