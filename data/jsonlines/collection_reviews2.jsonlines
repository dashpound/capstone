They HAVE to be the best in their class....about $600 the pair.....but typical planars....small imaging.....4 ohm power hungry.....sound slightly strained.....4 or 5 Feet out from the wall.....but still....I wanted more.I bought a set of ElectroMotion ESLs from Amazon. I power them with a 35 YO Receiver, the NAD 7175. It is so good, it is scary accurate.If you buy a Small stereo system, it sounds like you have a small sound coming out of a small box......If you buy Better tower Speakers.....it might sound like you are setting at a concert on the 50th row of a 100 row theater.If you buy some very, very good box speakers.....it might move you down to the first rows......And it might not.But if you buy really well made and balanced ElectroStatics, like these MartinLogans....the artists are in your living room.You can hear them breathing.......Some say the Bass is thin. Don't believe them. Unless you are a devotee of \"Ace of Bass\" music....the bass is Full and accurate.They are going to break in and get better........ :)These are fabulous speakers.BEST in class."}

But I didn't and both me and my wife weer pleasantly amazed at the ease of use and high quality pictures we got immediately. I suspect people play with the settings and especially the high iso one and end of with less resolution for low light which may not be needed anyway. The auto function works extemely well as it select the best scene, focus and shutter. All our initial pictures were just perfect, even under less than idea conditions. For my book I give it an overall 4.5, and that is just because the camera is still new and still learning the full features, I would recommencd it as others have. None were blurred."}

{"reviewerID":"AEL8SXIP0GNYU","reviewText":"The sound quality of this unit is phenomenal.  We have a Bose SoundDock II as well and there is really no comparison.  The HK sounds very noticeably MUCH better.  You will not need \"golden ears\" to hear the difference.  The sound of the HK, as many others have noted, is rich, full and clear, with a surprising degree of quality sound in the lower frequencies (tight, punchy bass).  Got this one for my wife to take to her office and, if she ever actually does that, I'll probably end up buying another one."}

The adjustment controls work great and the unit locks down solid after installation & adjustment. To be ultra picky, I would prefer a projector specific mounting plate instead of the infinitely adjustable arms. I'm told they make them but haven't been able to locate one for my application. Not that it would work any better, I'd just prefer the \"custom\" approach instead of the \"universal\" that's all. In any event you won't be disappointed with this purchase."}

{"reviewerID":"AWF6W5KZJBF9E","reviewText":"I found this keyboard case to be very flexible and well thought out. I own two other cases from another manufacturer and in comparing found the Airbender equal to or superior.Pros: The case design is well thought out, very functional and lightweight. I travel frequently for work and this case would be a great companion to my travel gear. The hard cover offers a good mix of protection and minimal weight added for travel, the swivel mechanism allows for easy adjustment and swapping from tablet to laptop mode. It also adds minimal thickness or bulk to your iPad.The keyboard is very nice to type on, with good stroke and a very efficient use of keyboard layout. In comparing to the other guys the better layout along with additional function keys (lock, highlighted cut\/copy\/paste, home, lock etc.) makes it the clear winner. My other keyboards bury useful functions like the tab on a letter key, making typing inefficient or clumsy. Not with the Airbender Air!Another feature I particularly liked was the upper shell that the iPad air actually mounts into. There is a nice protective lip all the way around it. This affords protection for the ipad and makes for a secure mount. I noticed some reviews of this unit mentioned difficulty removing the unit. I did not find this to be an issue. The brief instruction sheet that comes in the box has clear and easy to follow instruction on how to do that. Lastly the fact that it covers the whole ipad, makes this a better design. One of my other keyboards (a well known brand that cost nearly 4X the Airbender) has broken twice and can no longer be trusted to hold my iPad. They&#8217;d do well to copy NEWTRENT&#8217;s design. Lightweight is great as long as it can be relied on. I prefer security.The unit is shipped with a nice long micro usb cable. Lots of manufacturers skimp here but not NEWTRENT. I have not had the unit long enough to gauge the battery life, but with modern lithium technology and NEWTRENT&#8217;s experience with batteries I am betting that&#8217;s not an issue.Overall the unit looks very premium, was packaged well and has caught lots of peoples attention while I travel. At a price of $29.95 it is an astounding deal. Just buy it, you won&#8217;t regret it.Cons: No product is perfect, but again at this price point and quality one or two minor issues are negligible. I&#8217;d like a backlit keyboard and another color option (white), but I would imagine this would likely raise the price and cause a hit in battery life.Ratings:Value for price 5 ***** (but I&#8217;d give it a 6 if possible)Functionality 5 *****Ease of Use 5 *****Overall 5 *****"}

The mounting bracket worked great and should work for most other TVs that have 2 holes in the back to mount the vertical bars to.  Once attached to the TV, you simply mount the wall bracket with the built in level (LOVE IT), and then hang your TV on the bracket.  It is very low profile, and a cinch to set up.  All of the pieces come in a bag with each one clearly labeled.  And the best part is that the price was very low.  Highly recommend!"}

Then, I saw a rash of blog posts praising the new Echo pens and had to try it.I am terrible about writing this down in a regular notebook and then never looking at it again. Either that, or it takes forever for me to flip through hundreds of pages looking for something. I recently decided I needed to do something about that so I started using Evernote and Things to become more productive. Still, I was missing something.When I first received the pen, I was one of the unlucky ones who had the dreaded \"Upgrade the pen software\" error when trying to use the included dot paper. I talked with support and found out that there was a firmware issue that affected some people. Drat. This didn't seem to be off to a good start.Fortunately, within a couple days, the new firmware was posted and I was able to get started. So far, no issues at all. I use Mac OS X and the software works great.My only gripe is the lack of functionality to convert handwritten notes to text. You need to purchase a 3rd party application for that for an extra $30. If that feature was included, I would rate the pen 5 stars in a heartbeat.Now that I have this, the rest falls on me to do the rest. So far, so good. Part of my post-meeting workflow now is to copy the images into Evernote and add my tasks to Things. So long abandoned papers!UPDATE: Didn't realize the notes to text software was included.

{"reviewerID":"A3NXH2PFO8SMC8","reviewText":"I wish Logitech would get some decent Mac programmers. Honestly. I've used a number of keyboard\/mouse combinations over the years from them because they make the nicest feeling peripherals in the price range, but their Mac support sucks. They install a crappy control panel, make you restart, settings don't stick between reboots and half the time the peripherals aren't recognized by the software.Take this KB\/mouse combo, for example. I downloaded latest Logitech Control Center this morning (3.3.0) and I'm running OS X 10.6.4. I installed and restarted and the keyboard still isn't recognized by the software so I can configure it properly. The most basic thing they could have possibly done - remapping the cmd and option keys so they are in the right places - doesn't even get done. And there's no way to change it in the settings. As I've said, I've used many Logitech keyboards in the past so I usually just remap them manually using the Keyboard pref pane. That *doesn't work with this device* because of the newfangled USB Unity thing. I can't remap the keys at all. Worse, trying to remap them kills the mouse button mappings (switching the CMD and option keys in the Keyboard pref pane also does it for the custom mappings on the mouse). I don't know who's fault this is - Apple's or Logitech's - but I don't care. The KB\/mouse is nigh on unusable in OS X.The only reason it gets 3 stars is because it works well in Windows. Stay away if you primarily use OS X."}

The adapter fits perfectly into a slot in the back of the TV which was obviously made for the physical characteristics of this apdater. Within 5 minutes of plugging it in, it had synched with my home wireless router, and was up and running. My adapter is on the other side of the house, and I experienced no performance issues. My recommendation, if your Sony TV owner's manual specifies this adapter, buy it. All I can figure is that the people complaining are technically challenged, did not have a Sony TV, or would have issues plugging in a microwave oven."}

{"reviewerID":"ANCIWXTLRK2XJ","reviewText":"I bought a $200 surveillance camera that connected to my VCR several years ago, I always wanted something that connected to my laptop to allow me to record in digital format. This was my dream come true.  Plus it's remote viewing AND you can control the position of the camera. I LOVE IT!I've only had it for a couple weeks but it's been great. Let me preface that I haven't tried to use it past my cable modem, i.e. outside my local router. That's a cool feature as well, but not what I need.I pulled it out of the box, connected it to my router, installed software and BAM! I had access to the camera.  Then I configured for wireless and put the camera in the front window and had remote control. It was very easy. If you can set up a router, you can set up this camera (at least for local viewing).I've been recording my property for the past two weeks and I love it. How nice not to have to use a VCR to review video.I have a question however, is there a way to schedule recording aside from motion detection or alarms?  This is my only issue to date. I'd like to be able to record while I'm away and schedule it. I can always use some macro that clicks on record, then clicks off record and schedule that on my computer.There were a few issues setting it up, namely it didn't initially say what the admin password was in the manual which it later revealed. Also, I hide the SSID on my router and I had to give that up to use this camera. I wasn't happy about that, but at least it's password protected.Also, the IR night vision is amazing, but you really can't use it through a window which is what I wanted.Overall 5 stars. For $80 this made me very happy. Just what I wanted. I may get another for the backyard!  Good quality so far.WARNING: If you have an older router, I had a Cisco wireless-G router, this camera will mess up your router. When I turned on the camera and then turned on my computer, the computer would not recognize the router. I replaced the router with a new wireless-N and it works like a charm now."}

The factories in China that make this also make changes to the chipsets without making model number changes and use the general UG802 designation for it, making it very easy to mess up the device when you root or flash it due to improper chipsets in it.

No, it doesn't have a remote, but this speaker was not meant to sit on a pedestal on one end of your 100 ft. loft with you on the other end in a recliner.

{"reviewerID":"A3FEGTOLCWXSV4","reviewText":"On paper, this laptop has a lot going for it - a 3rd generation Ivy Bridge i5 dual core processor, 6 GB RAM, a 15.6\" multi touch screen, a 5GHz wifi adapter (Atheros AR5BWB222), 3 USB ports (1 USB 3.0), 5 hour battery life (as per the product specs - in reality this is about half that), and a modern design aesthetic.Unfortunately, the more I used it, the more I ran into its limitations, and hence my 3 star (It's Okay) rating.1. Performance.Its Windows Experience Index numbers (on a scale of 1 to 7.9) are:Processor (6.9), Memory (7.1), Graphics 4.5, Gaming (6.2), Hard disk (5.9)The V5 is really hurt by its anemic Intel HD Graphics 4000 chip (only 128MB of dedicated video memory); as well as by its 5400 RPM hard drive.2. ConstructionThis is a handsome laptop, but its cut corners soon become apparent with use - it feels plastic-ky and less well finished than my other laptops.3. Usability - TouchpadThe touchpad is located too far to the left making left clicks a challenge, has a stiff click action, and tends to lose sensitivity when performing click-drag operations (when closing Modern\/Metro apps, touch pad drags were often ignored.)It supports Win8 actions such as invoking the Charm menu, but these were easy to trigger inadvertently yanking me out of my thoughts.4. Usability - KeyboardThe keyboard is firm, full sized, and backlit. However, some keys are simply too small, and the Caps\/Num Lock keys provide no indication when active.5. Usability - Touch screenThe touch screen is the perfect complement to Windows 8's Modern\/Metro interface, and is natural to use. However, right click and click drag actions were harder to pull off, and I kept resorting to the mouse.Reaching across the keyboard can be an uncomfortable action depending on user position.Touching the screen can also be sacrilegious for those sensitive to screen smudges :)6. ScreenThe display was sufficiently bright, with adequate color reproduction. Its 1366x768 resolution is measly for a 15.6\" screen, but has the benefit of making text easier to read and icons easier to click - since each pixel is larger.7. No built-in Ethernet\/VGA portsIn a tragic design decision, these ports are only available using a separate adapter cable. That means I not only have to pack this itty bitty connector each time, but I also have to worry that I will misplace it :(8. Battery life - even with light use, the battery ran down in 3 hours. This is too short for mobile use.9. Integrated Optical Drive - a nice touch, but as expected at this price point, Bluray is not supported.10. SoftwareThis unit was surprisingly clear of bloatware (except for NTI Media Maker). Even the trial Windows Office 2010 is a download link. Unfortunately, Acer was just as sparing with useful software.Who is this for?###########This laptop seems to be aimed at users with light to moderate usage needs - it should be adequate for Internet browsing\/streaming, general home use, and for school homework. The larger pixels at this resolution and screen size should also be easier on older eyes.However, gamers, road warriors, developers, and other power users will likely be better served elsewhere.Conclusion#######While this may seem to be a lot of laptop for the money, I found that there were some material compromises.How satisfied you will be with this laptop will depend on which of these compromises matter to you.Happy Computing!"}
{"reviewerID":"A1DMVNB3A02CL6","reviewText":"If you're looking for a Linux dial-up modem, this is the one to get.  It's truly a hardware modem and uses the USB communications device standard.  Linux detects the device using the standard USB communication driver and it woks with \"pppd\" and KDE KPPP.If you're looking for a Windows modem this is still a great modem but you can get less expensive software modems.  One advantage for Windows users is the bundled BVRP Phone Tools fax, terminal and phone book software.  I've used this software with other US Robotics modems and it works great on all versions of Windows from Windows 2000 through Windows 7.  Please be aware that it only works with the US Robotics modem and not other modems you may have installed.  Since the modem is a true hardware modem it won't use as much of the computer's processing to communicate over dial-up.  It's also less likely to cause operating system problems and crashes since it doesn't use a special OS service or driver.The modem is light, small and well constructed.  It comes with a decently long phone cord including a ferrite donut to cut down on radio interference.  It works fine with any phone cable but the phone cable may affect nearby radio devices without the ferrite donut.  I haven't had any problems with any phone cord.There is a small green power light and a small phone communication light to show what the modem is doing.  I thought those were a nice feature since I could tell immediately when the OS detected the modem (the power light came on).  I also could tell when the modem was communicating because the data light would blink.As I mentioned the software included is BVRP Classic Phone Tools for Windows.  It has a CD with drivers and software, including a \"README\" file for Linux users.  If you're having trouble figuring out the Linux device name, look at the Linux README on the CD.A printed manual is included, but it doesn't have a lot of information.  There's just enough to get the modem installed and working so you need to read the Phone Tools documentation.  The printed manual is in multiple languages and that makes it seem like it has more than it actually does.It may not be obvious but this modem also can send and receive faxes.  The Phone Tools software for Windows has a fax capture driver that will let nearly any program print a document to the fax.  Phone Tools gives you a chance to add a cover page and review the document before you send it.  My only complaint about the print to fax driver is that you have to print all the pages using the same program.  You can't add more pages to a fax after creating it.  I've had to resort to pasting multiple pages into word documents or merging Acrobat documents so that I can make everything into one fax.  Considering what the software does for the price it's a great program.The modem does get warm after a while but not even enough to be uncomfortable to hold in your hand.  I haven't had any problems with long-term operation and it communicates as fast as the phone line quality allows.  The best part is that it doesn't have any noticeable effect on the speed of the computer and doesn't require any special software.My only complaint about the modem is the price, but it isn't exorbitant compared to other true hardware modems for PCI or PCMCIA.  Since it uses USB it is much more compatible with any computer, from a desktop to a netbook.  Almost everything has a USB port and most operating systems support the USB communications device standard.  Even though it's not cheap this modem will be useful for a long time, even with the inevitable computer technology changes.  A PCMCIA or Expresscard modem might not be compatible with older or newer laptops and is no more convenient to plug in and use.For Linux, you only need to buy one of these modems and connect it to whatever computer you happen to be using.  Linux HAL detects it and you can use it immediately after plugging it in.  You don't have to reboot or type in shell commands.  If you're hesitating about the price, consider that it will save you time on every Linux computer where you need to use dial-up.  The software modems included with most computers (especially laptops) are hard to get working and may stop working when you install newer versions of Linux.  Also the software modem drivers tend to require undesirable kernel options such as no preemption in order to work.  You have none of those issues with this little modem because it uses no extra software on Linux.The bottom line is that this modem is worth every penny in spite of the rather high price.  Amazon super-saver shipping takes a bit of the sting out of the price."}

For a front radiator, the hard drive bays will need to be modified and cut to fit a dual rad. I replaced all the 140mm fans (5 total) with Xigmatek crystal series red LED and removed the side mesh for a custom window to optimize airflow and improve the look. For now the dual 230mm top fans are the only stock fans installed. In some areas, the metal isn't finished well and can have a cheap feel and appearance. If you can get this on sale, then go for it. Otherwise, pass and find a case better designed. For the front radiator, the HDD cage will need to be removed, but a 5.25 cage in the top for HDD's will compensate for this. However, tons of room for any installing anything you want."}

However my itouch gets scratches, glares in the sun, and is sometimes hard to glide the finger across the glass screen, dampens my experience with my itouch. Using power support anti-glare film for itouch 2g has provided me exactly what I needed. A screen protector that protects from scratches, enables one to see the screen without glares from the sun, and a smooth gliding.Easy to apply, just thoroughly clean the itouch screen, then use the pre-application(the white paper) and apply it onto the screen, and remove. This removes all dust or any remaining particles that is not removed by thoroughly cleaning it. Then take out the 1 of the 2(yes 2) screen protectors, and apply it onto the itouch screen. Be careful not to touch the adhesive part of it, and be careful when you are about to place it down as it attracts to the screen. After you apply it, simply use the cloth that came with the itouch, or a lint free cloth to remove any air bubbles formed. It is to your best advantage you do not use it until one day has passed because it will allow the screen protector to fully attach it, and any remaining air bubbles you could not remove will be gone(My opinion that you should wait one day, you do not need to do this.)I have bought this on 09\/23\/2009, and today's date is 10\/24\/2009, one month and one day. The screen protector is still intact, there are no scratches still, it is still easy for me to glide my finger across, there are no air bubbles, I am still able to see the screen under the sun, and it still remains the best screen protector I have used."}

{"reviewerID":"A2HSCJ5XN882NJ","reviewText":"Short story: with another 3' cable, will not charge phone fast, results in a slow charge.I bought these along with a 3ft Male to Micro USB 2.0 AmazonBasics cable.  The idea was to charge my phone with them.  My micro connectors tend to break\/wear out so I thought an extension would work well.  (aka just buy the smaller cable to replace rather than the long cable)The two combined when plugged into my stock Moto X wall plug is a slow charge. If I take the smaller 3ft cable and plug it directly into the charger I get a fast charge.I've done some reading online and the consensus is that the extension cables are NOT GOOD for charging.  The act of extending (connecting the two cables) introduces resistance to the line and thus they slow the power that can flow to the device.I would have been smarter to buy two 12ft cables from another well known cable website for the same money.  I could have bought  2x the cables even if not extension cables, I could have bought 2x the cables and just worn through them."}

{"reviewerID":"A1NADKSHMF3S6K","reviewText":"I bought this friction mount for my Nuvi 350, and used both on a recent driving vacation.  Both worked even better than expected!Amazon's listings are a little confusing--If you have a Nuvi, don't buy the one that says \"for Garmin GPS\".  Get this one instead.  With this one, you don't need to purchase anything else, just use the little bracket that comes with the Nuvi unit.  (Put the bracket onto the mount without the GPS in it--it takes some pressure or a little twisting to get the bracket to snap onto the ball of the mount.  But once it's on, you won't need to take the bracket off the mount.  The GPS snaps into and out of the bracket easily--the bracket and mount stay together as one piece.)The literature with the GPS unit said that the dash mount adhesive is hard to remove, so I didn't want that on my car's dash.  Some reviews said the windshield mount could melt to the glass and I didn't want that, either.  Also, some say that thieves will break into your car even if they can only see the windshield mount, assuming the GPS is in the car somewhere.  So, I wanted the friction mount.  It was about $28 at amazon.After using it, I like it even better than I thought I would.  It holds VERY well; I never had a problem with it slipping even once.  It's easy to reposition, for example if the sun is hitting it the wrong way, and it's easy to put into the console when you park so that nothing shows to tempt theives.  Also, it can just stay plugged in to the car's power outlet.  The cord plugs into the bracket on the mount instead of directly into the Nuvi, which is convenient.  The Nuvi unit itself easily releases from the mount, with no cords to unplug, and is easy to take with you.The only disadvantages I can come up with are that it is a separate purchase (but is complete), and it's not beautiful (but neither are the other mounts, I guess).If you can't or don't want to use the windshield or permanent dash mounts, try this one.  I'm glad I bought it.A suggestion to amazon would be to describe all these mounts & other accessories a little better--lots of postings say they bought the wrong mount or bought accessories that were already included with the GPS unit, because they were listed on the product page with the GPS unit.By the way, I love the Nuvi 350!"}

{"reviewerID":"A3JZNR4U0L9HTK","reviewText":"If you are a somewhat frequent phone dropper, or your work necessitates your phone be well protected, I can't imagine a much better case than the Commuter.  It offers a nice balance between not being obscenely big, while at the same time, it's two part construction offers great protection.The inner silicone wraps around the phone first.  Its function is twofold: first, because it's what is in immediate contact with your phone, it's nice that it's soft, protecting from scuffs and scratches.  Secondly, when the case is completely assembled, it offers a fair degree of \"shock-absorption\" for falls from reasonable heights.  There are nicely fitted high quality rubber plugs for the USB and headphone jacks.  Button overlays for the power and volume rocker are easy to depress, and have a nice tactile \"click\" to them when everything is all assembled.The outer shell is a hard plastic which is mostly smooth, but does have a very subtle texture on the back.  Overall, it has a very nice feel to it.  It requires a bit of gentle maneuvering to get it to fit correctly over the silicone inner piece, but once on, everything fits nice and snugly.  Very nice fit and finish.  The cutouts are all very precise.  This is a very high-quality case.The main drawback is that there is a fair amount of bulk added to the phone with this case, making it difficult for me to carry in all situations.  Getting the phone in and out of dress pants or jeans pockets when it's in this case can be somewhat challenging.  Also, as others have mentioned, the inner silicone layer is a lint and dust magnet.  After having this case on my phone 24-7 for about a month, I ended up switching for a lower profile case which was more suited to my every day use.  I still turn to the Otterbox in certain situations, as the protection it provides is certainly second to none.A final word about the extended battery:The case will not fit correctly with the extended battery in the phone.  To me, having the extended battery was a must, so I looked into how I could have the best of both worlds.  There are a couple of ways around this.  1) You could put the phone in the case without the battery cover on, or 2) you could modify the standard battery cover so that it can accomodate the extended battery using a dremel tool (several guides on the internet if you Google it).  I opted for option #2, and with some careful dremeling, I was able to use the extended battery with the standard battery cover, and the phone perfectly fit in the Otterbox Commuter."}

I looked for solutions online, and came across this, checked out the reviews, and purchased it.The actual issue was that some channels, particularly in the HD offerings were just not tuning in. This solved most of the issues (by no fault of the device, according to the internal sensors it raised it as much as stated, the signal just really sucks). Not a big deal for me, but you do have to supply your own coaxial connection between the power brick and amplifier. The other thing to note is that it is warm to the touch, so you want to be careful where you put it, as blocking the air flow around it can cause it to get hot.The only other thing that can be a bit annoying is trying to manage the arrangement of the connections, but that is going to be so dependent on the placement of your outlet and incoming signal, I don't feel right judging it."}

{"reviewerID":"A2F4A55ENQBQ6U","reviewText":"I was completely surprised at how easy this set up was, and at first while reading the instructions I started to overthink it.  Don't.  One person can do this from point A & then B.  My house was built in 2003, I am in central eastern Florida, and with the main modem (docsys 3) getting just over 40mbps I tested my connection on the other end of this setup and it's getting the same.  And that's at the opposite end of the house.  I originally bought a signal booster by them but it didn't like my provider's modem for some reason so I returned it and went with these, and I'm glad I did.  My Netgear N900 wireless adapter for my laptop is great, and this powerline adapter is as well.  So far they're batting 1000 with me.  The utility from the Netgear support site is neat, and a quick download.  Not needed, but nice to have and will help keep you informed about available support software updates."}

{"reviewerID":"A106JMRSLCPDSV","reviewText":"Finally, a keypad with a TAB key! If you are looking for a good quality keypad that truly allows you to enter data with one hand, I highly recommend this product. The keys are over-sized, which makes it easy for folks with big fingers to operate. The keys have a nice, springy action to them that give good tactile feedback. In fact, it feels more like the keyboard of a high quality desk calculator than your run-of-the-mill keypad. I would have given it five stars, but one of the rubber feet is missing from the bottom. This does not affect the performance of the keypad at all.I bought this keypad because I was specifically looking for one with a TAB key. As the manager of a bowling association, one of my tasks is to enter scores for bowlers from award sheets into the bowling program. They computer provided by the association does not have a numeric keypad, but I happened to have one from another computer. It was better than nothing, but when entering the scores, I would have to hit the TAB key on the main keyboard. This slowed me down considerably. This new keypad now allows me to enter the scores one-handed and has definitely sped up the entering of the scores. If you have to do a lot of numerical entry, you can't go wrong with this keypad -- even if your existing keyboard has one built in."}

{"reviewerID":"A1CSRR7FCKBL9M","reviewText":"I bought this to, well, look at the sun without going blind. Of course packaging was good and the item was not damaged. It is just a slip on friction fit for my SkyQuest XT8. There is no obvious way to tell if it is on all the way but if you measure it out, you will get used to it. Make sure it is on all the way; it would be very painful to have it fall off while observing. I also do not feel the plastic thumb screws are effective. Tightening them feels like they will be easy to strip out. After mounting it, I went to check out the sun. It is actually a little hard to find ironically, since you can't (well, shouldn't) use a reflex sight. It shows up as a pretty boring yellow\/orange ball. You can see some sunspots which is cool for a few minutes then it gets a little old. As another reviewer mentioned, this would be great for an eclipse though. They also do not include any type of protective case\/sleeve so keep that in mind when ordering. Honestly, I would recommend you borrow this from a friend before buying."}

{"reviewerID":"A1BT6TL7UCIC5Y","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting much from this headset considering other bluetooth headsets I have used suffered from a background hissing noise when listening to music.  I'm pleased to say that these headphones don't suffer from a hiss.I'm impressed by the sound produced by these headphones.  The music sounds crisp.  These headphones are even good for classical music.Pairing it with my Nokia N9 was easy.  The phone instantly recognized the headphones and I only had to click \"connect\" within my phone interface to get the devices paired.Battery life is OK.  I estimate they power lasts about 5 hours, solely listening to music.I can also skip songs, change the volume, and pause the music from the little controls on the wire.  The device speaks in your ear to indicate when the device is turned on, turned off, or if the battery is running low.  The battery warning startles me since all of a sudden, a female voice starts speaking in my ear.  I think a little beep would have been a better warning.  On the other hand, the power on\/off alerts are useful.The fit of the headphones is OK, but I wouldn't jog or run with them on as they would likely fall out.  The buds are larger than others I have used and it took awhile to get used to the way they fit.Despite my quibbles, I think these headphones are an excellent choice if you're looking to get rid of the wire from your phone to the headphones.  My high rating is based on the great sound quality of these headphones in comparison to other bluetooth headphones."}

It's nice that you can put the receiver into the mouse for storage and it also serves as an off switch but for those of us who rarely travel it's not so convenient to have to unplug the USB receiver each time you power down just to save battery life. I wish it had a normal on off switch or an idle timer to power down after inactivity.The best feature for me is that it's not too big and not too small. It fits my palm well and has a nice responsive feel."}
{"reviewerID":"AAOPCU3MVKYRN","reviewText":"Like many others, I purchased these headphones for a ridiculously low price via Groupon. My headphones arrived after about three weeks and while they looked fine, they simply didn't work. The noise canceling didn't appear to do much of anything. If anything, it made noise louder! The headphones provided more noise isolation when the noise canceling feature was turned off. In addition every time one of the end-plates fell of the right earphone, which was frequently, the headphones emitted ear-destroying noise at maximum volume!Sadly, Able Planet has some of the worst customer service it has been my misfortune to encounter. If I'd had ANY idea of how bad it was, I would NEVER have done business with the company! Getting an RMA so my defective headphones could be exchanged was a three week process that involved numerous e-mails, web forms, and phone calls. Once I returned the headphones, it took Able Planet THREE months to furnish a replacement!The replacement headphones work as well as they ever will and they're thoroughly disappointing. Without batteries installed and the noise-canceling circuitry on, the headphones are muddy to the point of being useless. With the active circuitry engaged the sound is adequate at best; about what you'd expect from a $30-40 headphone not something that costs this much. Most of the noise cancellation seems to take place in the lower octaves. They're probably great at blocking out the constant low-pitched hum you hear while on an airplane. If you're looking to dampen the discussions happening in the cubicle next to you, the construction sound from across the street, or your own horrible singing you'll need to look elsewhere: there's some minimal attenuation in these frequency ranges, but not enough to be useful.Ultimately, I find that there's nothing to recommend these headphones. They don't stand out for sound quality, comfort, or noise cancellation and certainly not for customer service. Mine will end up at the bottom of a landfill before too long, I'm sure..."}

{"reviewerID":"A3NEAETOSXDBOM","reviewText":"Sometimes when you travel there is no USB port on a laptop or AC outlet on a wall that is available to power your electronic devices when their battery charges start running low. This product is perfect for those situations. It is nice and compact, and comes with multiple adaptors to power and\/or recharge a wide variety of electronic products. The included adaptors provide a backup for my iPod Touch 2G, iPod Nano 2G, Samsung cell phone, bluetooth headset, Garmin Forerunner 305, and Garmin Nuvi 660.Additional adaptors for other gadgets(such as for the Amazon Kindle) are available at a modest price.Here are a few comments to keep in mind:1. You can charge only one item at a time. Therefore when you reach your destination and have access to an AC outlet, if you wish to charge multiple items simultaneously, this is not the item to do that (I recommend the Callpod, which I have reviewed on Amazon). [But see my April 24, 2010 update below. I figured out a way to do it and no longer use the Callpod.]2. If you have a USB AC adaptor that you use for your iPod Touch or Nano, it will work fine to charge this unit. There is no need to buy a separate adaptor.3. Once the unit is fully charged, you can just leave it plugged in to the charging source (I checked with Tekkeon tech support, which is very helpful and responds quickly). That way you can be sure that the unit will always have a full charge when you need it.4. This unit will not power a laptop or comparable electronic product. But Tekkeon does sell more powerful (and more expensive) units that will do so.5. I chose this unit rather than the less expensive MP 1550, which runs on AA or rechargeable batteries, because in my experience I have found that a power source with its own internal battery lasts longer than one relying on batteries. Of course, the flip side is that once this unit runs out of power, you can't just pop some fresh batteries in. However, that is not an issue for me, though something that you may want to consider.This product looks nice, is simple to operate, and does what it says. I am very happy with it.Update August 22, 2009: I like this so much that I use it at home on a daily basis. The unit has two USB ports--a mini and a regular. Using the included retractable cable, I plug one end into the mini on the unit and the other end (which has a regular USB) into an Apple travel charger that is plugged into the wall. That way this unit is always at full charge if I take it on a trip. I use the free regular USB port on the unit to charge a variety of devices (though one at a time) that come with a USB cable, such as my BlackBerry and iPod Touch [But see April 24 update below re how to charge more than one at a time]. It is more convenient for me to charge them on this unit than to plug them into my laptop (which I do only when I need to sync data).I have also found the built in flashlight on this unit a nice feature to have when rummaging through my bags looking for some gizmo that I can't find.Update November 24, 2009: I recently stayed in a very nice hotel where the bedroom was really dark at night, but there was no nightlight in the bathroom. Solution: I just turned the flashlight on this unit on all night (8 hours)in the bathroom. Not only did the light last through the night, but it took only a relatively short time (less than 20 minutes) to restore the unit to a full charge.Update April 16, 2010: Customer service for this company is first rate. On a recent trip I realized that I did not have a micro USB tip that would fit my BlackBerry Tour and Kindle 2. I emailed customer service after I returned home, and was advised that this tip was supposed to be included with the product. But since I bought my unit over a year ago, it was not included then. When I explained the situation to Jerry at customer service, he mailed me the tip at no cost within 24 hours. It's always nice to know that a quality product comes with quality customer service.Update April 24, 2010: If you would like to use this product to simultaneously power more than one USB device at a time, there is an easy way to do it. I use the Belkin mini USB 2.0 hub (which I have reviewed on Amazon) and plug it into this unit, and now have four USB ports for my gadgets. The more gadgets you plug in, the faster you will drain the unit. But it is handy, for example, on a longer plane ride or at the beach for my wife and me to each plug our Slacker G2 players into the hub, which is in turn connected to the MP 1800, in order to extend the playing time. I also use the same technique for my Kindle 2, BlackBerry Tour, iPod Touch, and Garmin Forerunner 405CX.Also, when you arrive at your destination, just connect this unit to an AC adaptor as I described in an earlier comment above, connect the hub to this unit, and now with AC power you can simultaneously not only recharge this unit, but also recharge up to four USB devices--all without a computer or bringing along the separate USB adaptors for each device (though being a \"belts & suspenders\" kind of guy, I still bring them along just in case for some reason the hub should fail since \"Murphy's law\"--if something can go wrong, it will go wrong--has kicked in on more than one vacation). Note: What I have described only works with the type of relatively low power draw USB devices that I have mentioned above. Also if you are drawing too much power for all the devices connected, the light will flash on the Belkin mini hub and\/or on the Tekkeon MP1800. If that happens, just disconnect one or more devices until the flashing stops.Update September 11, 2011: Due to Hurricane Irene, the area in which we live was flooded and my wife and I were trapped in the house for 24 hours until the flood waters receded. We lost all power, and to my dismay the corded land line phone had gone dead. That left me with only my BlackBerry to communicate with friends and family.Power was not restored until four days later, but in the interim I had to return home during the day to supervise flood restoration crews and other persons. Each night I charged the Tekkeon at our friends' house, and brought it with me to my home during the day so I could keep my BlackBerry charged to make and receive calls and email. It worked like a champ.Bottom line: In emergency conditions, this unit proved critical and performed flawlessly.Update July 24, 2012: The unit recently \"died.\" When I plug it in to charge, the green light goes on and the flashlight works, but the second I disconnect it from the USB charging source, the green light goes off and nothing works. Customer service said it could be a defective switch, but I am well beyond the one year warranty period. However, I may continue to bring this as a nightlight when I travel since the flashlight will work so long as the unit is connected to a power source.Update August 7, 2012: I now use the Powergen mobile juice pack 5200, which I have reviewed on Amazon, and like it even better than this unit."}

{"reviewerID":"A3RUQO10JKY9NT","reviewText":"BACKGROUNDI recently purchased a new MacBook Air from Apple. As must of you know, products from Apple come at a premium and I wanted something to protect the top portion of my laptop as I worked. I previously purchased theBookArcby Twelvesouth as well as theirBackPackand was impressed by products and deeded to give their SurfacePad a chance.PACKAGE AND APPLICATIONThe SurfacePad arrives adhered to a piece of thick cardboard. The instructions on how to apply to the MacBook Air are printed on the backside along with tabs to help aid in separation of SurfacePad from the cardboard. Yes, for those wondering, the SurfacePad stays in place due to an adhesive. The great thing, though, is the adhesive does not leave a residue on the notebook once removed.APPEARANCEThe black of the SurfacePad as well as the print on the edges help it to blend in naturally with the MacBook Air and its black keyboard. It looks like it naturally belongs. It is also a very thin piece of leather and so it barely raises off the surface of the notebook during use.USEAGEThe SufacePad is comfortable during use. It is not raised on the notebook and is flat therefore I can rest my wrists on it perfectly while typing. Unfortunately, I did notice a big problem. There are several multi finger swipe commands that start off to the side of the trackpad with movement onto the trackpad. With the SurfacePad in place, these finger-swipes will not register and so these movements will not work.PROS:++ Perfect fit for the Macbook Air++ Blends in aesthetically with the rest of the MacBook Air++ Protects the aluminum casing from scratches & dirt from extensive useCONS:++ Many of Apples new finger swipe motions require you to use the side of your laptop surrounding the trackpad. This cover prevents those finger swipe motions from being preformedCONCLUSIONThis item does have a premium over similar products but that premium is displayed in the durability of the product. It protects your laptop, aesthetically  is pleasing, and is comfortable in use. Recommended overall."}

I had my continuous online cloud backup copying from this drive, which meant it never stopped spinning, but that should be no problem to a hard drive.  Very disappointed.Tried several computers and none of them recognizes when I attach the HD, every once i a while the HD shows up in the list of drives, but then I can't access it.  Sooo bummed.Cannot recommend this product as HD's are supposed to be more dependable than 1 year."}

Unlike most other bluetooth keyboards that will work with Android tablets, this keyboard has the special characters and functions that are also available on the Android touch screen. It works fine with any Android tablet. the keyboard is sturdy, thin, light-weight and the same width as the 10 inch tablet. Charges on mini USB while attached to the tablet or dock. it comes with a USB cable, but no charger. Power switch is located underneath the keyboard. device pairs easily and maintains connection. key operation is smooth. no sticking. device is top quality compared to other bluetooth kybds. I use it with the Toshiba Thrive 10\/32gb while docked in the Toshiba HDMI stand, or in the Toshiba portfolio flip case. A bluetooth mouse from another mfg completes the kit."}

{"reviewerID":"A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1","reviewText":"The Arctic 4500 home charger is a four-port USB charger for mobile devices well worth purchasing...but with some design choices that keep it from being a true five star product.The pros:-4 available charging ports with 4000mAh total output.-2 of the ports are fast charge ports for tablets (so, if you have a shiny new Kindle Fire HD but passed on the aftermarket charger: this will decrease your charging time).-LED charging status indicators (see the CONs below).The cons:-USB ports are placed on the short side edge of this charger.. For easy access to the USB ports, you'll have to mount this in the top plug of standard vertical 2-plug outlet. Not a problem, unless you wanted to use that plug for something else (which I do in the place where I am most likely to use this charger). While you could plug it into the bottom outlet, this will then remove the top outlet from use. This design choice should have been considered.-The LED flashing sequence indicating variations in charging load\/power output are indicated by the speed of flashing, and are not intuitive.As a charger: five stars, but less one star for design choices that limit its flexibility around already crowded outlets.Note: This item was provided for review purposes."}

{"reviewerID":"A1KRJAC8Z6AV7X","reviewText":"I have been using my N800 for a week now.  I have to say it is an amazing device.  I will add this right away, if you have vision issues you might not have as much fun using this, or other, devices of this size and resolution.  Reason being they are packing 800x480 pixels in a small screen size.  That means the pixels are smaller so characters will be in proportion smaller.  Yes, when using the browser you can \"zoom\" the display so that's nice but it can make a web page\/site very difficult to use.  I do not think of this as a short coming but rather just a fact of life for all small display's with high pixel density.  Just divide the number of pixels by the dimension of the display and then do the same for a larger display but with the same number of pixels and you see why the characters must be very teeny is some cases.  So, that past is just a heads-up for those who might not be aware of the issue and it really only applies to web browsing.  The font on the system itself are quite easy to read.I am going to be reading eBooks on the N800 and I can say that FBReader (pretty much the only ebook reader for the device or Linux for that matter) is an OUTSTANDING program and is very flexible allowing almost unlimited font sizing.  This make all the difference in terms of the above issue.  If you have visions probs and want tread ebooks on this device you can by simply setting a larger font size as well as background color.  But remember the software does not support any sort of DRM'd books.  If you want to read DRM'd books a good Palm based device (Sony Clie nx73v if you can find one or a Palm Tx) or a Kindle would be my suggestions.Next the absolute first you must configure the wireless so you can immediately upgrade to OS2008 before you do anything with the tablet.  Reason being is the can be compatibility issues between OS2007 apps and OS2008.  But it's painless and takes no more then 15-20mins.After that is done, it's time to poke and prod the system.  You will notice, no PDA functionality really.  And the built-in email app, well, it is marginal on it's best day.  You will need to look and depend on 3rd party apps for almost everything you use your PDA for.  And given the personality of Linux developers they are more interested in playing games and writing yet-another-audio-player type applications then they are using this powerful device for anything truly useful in terms of data.My biggest complaint with these devices is the lack of modular mobile broadband capability.  You cannot run a USB EVDO or HSDPA modem via the USB port because it can only operate in quasi-host mode called by Nokia On-The-Go.  That is because it only supplies about 100mV of current to the port for devices.  I understand it's a battery life issue.  Still the lack of ability to add a mobile broadband device severely limits where and when you can use your INTERNET tablet.  Odds are you did not buy this for home use...you bought it to be, well MOBILE.  But given the unpredictable nature of wifi hotspots it's harder to be mobile if there are not connectivity options.My work around for mobile connectivity was to buy a Cradlepoint CTR-350 USB Mobile Broadband Router that supports (as of firmware v2.x) both EVDO RevA as well as HSDPA USB modems.  Now this is NOT a self powered travel router but that is OK.  there is always the Cradlepoint PHS300 with a built-in battery if you prefer.  I opt'ed for a portable power solution using a Tekkeon MP1550 and eight (8) Ultra Low Discharge Sanyo Eneloop 2000mA AA batteries to use in the MP1550.  The MP1550 uses four AA batteries at a time.  With this setup I'll get a good 4-8 hrs of use of the router using the Franklin CDU680 EVDO Modem and EVDO service I have through Millenicom (better deal than via Sprint but over Sprint's EVDO system).  Plus this is a very light weight solution.  The other option I looked at was the Tekkeon myPower 3300.  A bit heavier but LOTS more power.  Still might go that router later on.I also bought three extra batteries for the N800.  I can now use it around 10-18hrs depending on wifi use.But you can see how the lack of a reasonable way to use mobile broadband in the N8x0 family of devices is an issue of you really want to be mobile.  But because it has a STRONG wifi set with excellent range and sensitivity, it's possible to create yourself as your own mobile hotspot.  I will carry the router\/modem\/power pack in a Tom Bihn Buzz bag because that is convenient for me.  But any carry bag will work.  Even a batman Utility belt... ;)So, anyway, I have been everywhere with the device and love it a lot.  There are not many applications for it yet...but such is the nature of things.  In order to get any sort of reasonable word processing you will need to run a different OS like KDE or some other port to the N8x0 devices.  But I am feeling this is just for now and will change soon enough.And do not expect video streaming to be all that great.  It is a very immature product line in that aspect.  It's basically a roll of the dice if you will ever see support for streaming of your fav video format.  And NSV will likely never happen.  You can stream lots of audio formats though.  Even Shoutcast using Streamtuner.It's new and the developers seem enamored with nothing but \"yet-another-audio-player\" type applications.  Real productivity applications are pretty much non-existent.  But you can use Google Docs so at least there is that, if you have an available Wifi internet connection that is...Oh, also if like to do crosswords on your PDA\/Handheld now...ummm, there are currently NO crossword puzzle applications which run on the N8x0 Maemo OS systems.  I am able to run my crossword application via the Garnet VM (Palm OS emulator for the Nokia Internet Tablets) so I can at least use it for that, sort of.  But I will not be getting rid of my Clie nx73 anytime soon because of this issue.Last there is no Java support yet.  There has been no port of a Java Runtime Module by either IBM or Sun.  That is a BIG hole in the potential for the N8x0 family of device.  So, if your application needs Java, it's gonna be a while, if ever.  I consider this a significant shortcoming as it should have been ready right and even part of the OS.Overall, it's an amazing and POWERFUL system with a lot of potential.  The display is amazing and vibrant.  Lots of storage potential with two SD (or SDHC) slots and the like.  But, I am not confident real professional grade applications will ever appear for the device in time.  So you will have to depend on web based applications like Google Docs to get any work done on the go.  And if you do want to do a lot of typing consider adding the iGo Stowaway Bluetooth folding keyboard.  It beats the heck out of the on screen keyboard and even the slide out for the N810.So, that is my long winded review.  I have to say I love the device it works well enough in the area's I need once I added the mobile broadband work around.  Now I have real internet access on a decent screen pretty much anywhere we roam without the need to lug around a laptop and at a fraction of the cost of a UMPC.  And just enough functionality, barely, out of the box to get things done.EDIT:There is now a GREAT freeware crossword puzzle program for the N8x0 series tablets.  The program is called Xword and is actually in the Maemo\/OS2008 repository.  So crossword puzzle fans can solve their daily NYT puzzles on the N8x0 series tablets.  Or any AcrossLite (.puz fromat) puzzles for that matter!!!"}
{"reviewerID":"A3HRLD5V6KCBKW","reviewText":"All of the past reviews gave me a pretty good idea of what to expect from this product, namely a low budget security system with average video quality. It does suffer from washed out colors and it may be difficult to positively ID someone but is sufficient to identify motion and that someone has entered the premises. It does have many configuration settings to satisfy most scenarios.There were two main unacceptable gotchas that I wasn't able to foresee:1. The web interface settings can only be accessed by installing an ActiveX plugin. This means you can only use Internet Explorer to see live video and access the DVR settings. Another review I read suggests that they do not provide an API (so that you can program somethihg yourself to see live video) and questions to the fact were not addressed in a postive manner by the manufacturer. Other cameras I've seen do not require the installation of a plug-in or if they do, offer you a choice to use a Java plugin which may be more accepted across browsers. The most secure method of viewing your DVR remotely is to VPN into your home network and hit the camera IP on your local network. This is not possible given what I mentioned above unless you are using Internet Explorer as your browser.2. You can set a schedule of when you want the DVR to record if it detects motion. However, if you want an email notification when motion is detected, you cannot schedule when you want it to do this...so you can only turn this feature on or off. It would make more sense if the email notification adheres to the schedule set for when the DVR records when it detects motion.Just to add, the motion detection email notification consists of a single image compared to my old Loftek camera which included 6 images in its email notification."}

{"reviewerID":"A1A8N3C4W8GGID","reviewText":"Let's start with the price. For under $10 with s\/h, you can't beat it. Some of the prices that are advertised on Amazon for cases are ridiculous, so this fits the bill. The color a simple black, I haven't seen this case offered in any other color. Fitting the tablet in the case is very simple. The case doesn't hinder any hand movements or gestures, so you have full access to the screen.  The rubber material is lightweight and thin, no unneeded weight or size. Since it does wrap the face of the tablet, you can lay the tablet face down without too many issues.Some would say that the case is not a tight enough of a fit, I will disagree. I feel the case fits snug enough without being difficult to remove for cleaning. If you pick and pull at the case then it will not stay to the molding of the case and not fit properly. Cleaning can be accomplished by washing in warm soapy water, rinse off then dry completely. There is a slight odor associated with the rubber, but really not noticeable. I mean who goes around smelling their case all day?All of the ports are completely accessible. Power and volume cover buttons push in easy without any extra effort. Camera and light sensor are exposed nicely. Speaker port on the case is a little bigger than the tablet speaker opening, which I feel helps the sound projection from being choked down. Even the docking pins are exposed.All in all a great tablet case for the Nexus 7 2012.I RECOMMEND THIS CASE TO EVERYONE, 100%"}

The brackets that connect your TV to the mount are flimsy. Trying to center my TV bent those way too easily. Hopefully they fix that in the future. A nice lady from Cheetah mounts contacted me. She was very concerned about my comments on the mount, and asked me a few questions about it. I answered them, and she was able to \"rectify\" the situation. I spent more time than I should have installing this mount, and had to do some things to make it work in my situation. Let's just say, I'm satisfied with how Cheetah Mounts handled this. Their costumer service is much better than most others I have experienced. I will buy from them again. The best I can give is 3*s, and it's mostly for the customer service, had to -2* for the flimsy mount.*Original Review:Significantly not as pictured. The arms that hold the tv to the mount are not as pictured. They are much thinner, and have many \"cheetah\" holes in them. They bend extremely easy while trying to center your tv. The levels that come with the mount are almost worthless. The \"built in level\" is no longer built in, and you are not able to place it in the center of the mount due to its horrible new design. Luckily I have a 4' level, and that's how I was able to get this mount on the wall properly. The mount itself gets 1*, I added another * for the hdmi cord. I have 2 other cheetah mounts in my house, and they are great, but I can not recommend this one. I'm more than likely going to replace it with a higher quality mount because I do not have much faith in this one. It says it can hold 165lbs, I have a 60\" Sharp Aquos that weighs maybe 65lbs, and I don't trust it."}

HOWEVER, when I was outside of the house, the sound was fine ONLY when I was still, but when I walked around outside of the house, the sound dropped frequently. If you want to use it outside, then you need to move the transmitter (and the music device) outside of your home and connect it to the outside outlet.3. THE HEADPHONE: It is comfortable, adjustable, but bit heavy (it has 2 AAA rechargeable batteries  - 1 on each side). So you need to get used to it. It has power, volume, dynamic bass boost, and 3D surround buttons on the right side of the headphone - which are small buttons, but great option. Since it covers your ears, it may cause you to sweat a little if you move around.4. THE TRANSMITTER: The transmitter comes with many options (power plug accessories for international usage) and cables for different electronic devices (TV, iPod, CD & Radio Player, etc). There is NO battery option for the transmitter. It needs to be plugged to the outlet all the time to be used. Also, the transmitter is used as rechargeable station for your headphone (the headphone has 2 AAA rechargeable battery on each side), which is an excellent idea. Also note that when you use the headphone - you MUST power on the transmitter AND the headphone each time you use it. There is no auto-power on.Overall, I LOVE this product - yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is a quality built and can be used with many electronic devices in the home. My wife loves it, when I go to bed she puts the wireless headphone on and watches TV from the bed - enjoying its undisturbed sound without disturbing me!  Highly recommended!"}

{"reviewerID":"AE88D7OM7YU99","reviewText":"My company recently moved me into an area that could not get noisier.  I would have better luck getting work done at a Kid Rock concert.  Actually, that is what I was doing.  Blasting my music to drowned out all the constant chatter.When I was in the electronic engineering field we had offices. When the door was closed that meant you were in a meeting or deep into your work. Unless it was an emergency, rarely was there a knock. You'd get a polite email asking for you to let them know when you were free.Not so in the software industry.  Now we are all in cube farms with constant racket and chatter.  I got these in hopes that the noise cancellation would allow me to keep the music volume down.  No luck.  The noise cancelation increases the volume a little but does nothing to drowned out the external noises.I know over the ear noise cancellation works best, but wearing glasses does not allow me to use those.The biggest negative though is these things can only be worn for a short time.  The buds are attached to a big plastic knob that pushes against your outer ear canal.  After an hour or two your ear starts hurting.  If you force yourself to continue wearing them after that, you end of with a soar ear the rest of the night.Over all I recommend going with a different brand unless you have really big outer ear canals and don't really mind that the noise cancellation does not work."}
{"reviewerID":"A27N71DX5BFHS8","reviewText":"This is written after using the laptop for about five weeks.  Overall, I am very pleased with this machine.  No buyers remorse yet :-).Pros:>  The laptop looks very nice with the brushed aluminum case, but the shiny surfaces inside, as others have pointed out are fingerprint magnets.  A quick swipe from time to time minimizes this problem for me.>  Stays cool in use (it doesn't get as hot as my previous HP laptop)>  Build quality seems very good.>  Screen is very sharp and bright - 1366 x 768 is perfectly adequate for my purposes as I won't be using the machine for graphics editing.>  The installed  Windows 7 boots up fast and seems very stable (more usable than Vista was on my desktop, which I upgraded to XP).>  Plenty of fast RAM (4GB DDR3) and a more than adequate HD (500GB).>  Battery life is excellent (major reason I selected this model); I'm getting at least 8+ hours battery life with heavy use.>  The video and cpu performance mode switches are \"seamless\" (the screen blanks for up to 1-2 seconds).>  Installation of Xubuntu went without a hitch and all hardware including the wireless adapter was automagically detected.  So I have a nice dual boot laptop (but see cons, below).Cons (not enough to knock off a star):>  Screen viewing angle is fairly small (not sure if this is really a big con unless you want to show a crowd of people something on the screen)>  The machine comes with a fair amount of pre-installed software to get rid of.  YMMV.>  I found Windows 7 UAC annoying enough that I turned it off.  No problems so far, but I'm fairly paranoid about securing my system.  Another YMMV.>  I find that Windows 7 hangs randomly on shutdown - I haven't had time to look into this yet, though.  There may be a Microsoft fix available.>  Another Windows 7 problem - I have an old program which wouldn't run even in compatibility mode (although it ran fine on an XP laptop).  I solved this by installing VirtualBox and building a Windows 2000 virtual machine, which runs the program perfectly.  This might be something to try if compatibility mode doesn't work for you and you have an old Windows disk lying around.>  Installing Ubuntu's Nvidia proprietary 3D Linux driver bricks the machine - well, not exactly bricks as the machine can be resuscitated, but an MBR repair and complete Linux reinstall was necessary (this happened twice as I thought that perhaps I'd done something wrong the first time).  Don't know why this should be as I never had trouble with NVidia's drivers on my Debian desktop.  Of course this won't happen to you if you don't install Linux ;-).Another point to note - ASUS partitions the HD with three partitions: a recovery partition, a \"C\" disk with the OS installed, and a \"D\" disk for data.  This may not be what you're used to, but it can easily be changed using Windows 7 disk management tools.  I repartitioned the disk anyway to install Linux.Overall I think the ASUS UL50Vt-A1 is excellent value for the $$.  Probably not good for heavy gaming, but plenty snappy in ordinary use.  I haven't had the same problems that others have had with the mouse pad, but it does take a little getting used to.  I haven't used the webcam much yet, except to see that it works.  I plan to use it for video chat and I think it will be OK for that.  I've connected the HDMI port to my HDTV, and the video is fine but I have to figure out how to get the audio through that cable too.  I also find that I don't use the ExpressGate feature, preferring to just boot the machine into an OS.  Perhaps I'll give it a try later."}

Unfortunately, that has been a problem that many people have felt with the Iphone, or other electronic devices. But for anybody whom owns a Ipod or a Iphone, they have to find something else to deliver. Energizer has delivered nicely with their Instant Charger, which requires their Lithium AA batteries. It actually works very well on the Ipod Touch as well as the Iphone 4 as well. You don't have to waste your time bringing that connector out with you, when you have to either charge it up, or sync it to the computer when you need to add your music. It works very well, and is definitely better than the Duracell backups for the Iphone, where you would have to charge them up by computer, and bring your connector out with you to keep it charged up. This works well, and is definitely a great buy, for all your Iphone and Ipod Touch needs.Price: BSetup: B+Overall: B 1\/2+"}

{"reviewerID":"A39ANGL5T77E0B","reviewText":"I guess the easiest way is to break this review up into pros and cons.PROS1.  Easily learns any signal from any infrared device.  I can even control my portable heater and fans with this remote.  Works with all my electronics, including my Comcast DVR.2.  Has GREAT range, works like an RF remote since you can point the remote in any direction and the signal registers.  Some of my old remotes had to be pointed directly at the device, this remote has great range.CONS1.  It is obvious Sony just used an old design they had leftover from some old remotes and decided to use the case as a universal remote.  The instruction manual is dated 2006 so you know it is at least four years old.  The remote feels like a 2 X 4 piece of wood, very uncomfortable.2. This remote is huge!  I am 6'3\" with very large hands and I can hardly hold this thing.  I laughed when I first opened the box since I couldn't believe how big it was.  Looks way bigger than the picture.  The cheap looking black and blue colors looks like a design from 1991.3.  Predefined buttons didn't work at all, not even for Sony products since again this remote was probably created back in 1990.  You can get the buttons to work if you manually program them all though.4.  I was mad to see that my local Walmart has a $19 dollar Philips remote that has the same features and is normal sized with comfortable looking curves.  I wish I would have tried that one instead.5.  The little menu\/guide\/exit buttons feel like pimples.  I feel if I rub them hard enough they may pop off the remote.6.  Like someone else has mentioned, it would have been great if there were two more buttons above the rewind\/play to serve as skip buttons, perhaps even page up and page down buttons above the volume and channel buttons would have been great too.7. All of the buttons feel alike besides the big volume and channel buttons.  I am the type of person who memorizes the placement of the buttons and feels for them, but this remote has flat buttons so they all feel alike.  I never noticed how well my Comcast remote is designed since all of the buttons have their own shape.  The reason I bought this remote was ONLY because I kept accidentally hitting that ON DEMAND button on my Comcast remote.  I even called Comcast to see if there were remotes without that button, and I even tried prying the remote apart to remove the on demand button, but those failed so I wanted to try this remote to see if I could replace it.So yeah it can control all of your infrared devices, but it is really big, ugly, and feels like a piece of wood.  I do use it for my stereo and DVD player, only for simple up\/down volume controls and skip functions.  I should design my own remote, cheap with slick curves.  Oh I just did a search and found the universal learning remote that is made my Philips here on Amazon:http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Philips-SRU5107-27-Universal-Control\/dp\/B0026L7B8K\/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1263806014&sr;=1-14I would recommend trying that remote as it looks more up to date, more comfortable, normal sized, and most of the common functions we use in this decade."}
{"reviewerID":"A1BEIDZ830XB9O","reviewText":"I wanted to see if Ethernet over power would work better than my existing solution of a 5Ghz wifi access point.The short answer so far is \"mostly yes\". The overall bandwidth is better, but the ping (latency) is slower (by about 50ms). Not sure why. This latency increase would only matter for gaming, which I'm not planning to do from that part of the house.I had some of the same setup issues that others have written about. Somehow it turned out that the most convenient outlet was the one outlet in the whole house that worked poorly. Seriously, I went around and tried most of them to see how this solution worked throughout the house. All worked fine except the one I had planned to use: it was maxing out at about 1-2Mbps. Ugh.  Thankfully, only five feet away was another outlet that worked fine.The one and only time I was able to get the link indicator to stay green was when the adapters were on the same circuit. I think that's about the only time you can count on 100+ Mbps performance. Otherwise, based on my experience and from what other people are writing, expect significantly less. I honestly can't tell if the indicator light is orange or red right now.I was finally able to get the encryption on the units to change, but it took several attempts at following the vague instructions. It works, but it is an exercise in frustration.THERE IS NO SOFTWARE to access the adapters and program\/monitor\/upgrade them. This is the reason I am taking one star off the review. It would be so much nicer if you could plug these suckers in and then configure them from your computer.Now that I know that Ethernet over power works, I'd probably splurge a bit more in the future and get units that come with control software and are firmware upgradable."}

{"reviewerID":"A2WCFDOCS73PNB","reviewText":"I have been using this product for the past few years. The typical life-cycle of this product is about two years. It worked quite well for me as I like the convenience of not needing to worry about losing the passwords to access the sensitive data.  It also works pretty well on windows XP and windows 7 OS.A word of caution in using this device. The device is partitioned into both public and private partitions. The private partition is where it stores the finger-print protected data. The device came with a default of 100%l public partition but zero private partition. If you move your data to the device without repartitioning, the data will be stored in the public partition which everyone can access even though the fingerprint protection is enabled. You would have to manually create the private data partition and then put your sensitive data there. The other area of caution is that once you have the device plugged in and unlocked with the fingerprint validation, the data is still accessible even after you power off and reboot the PC without the need to go through the fingerprint validation again. I believe this applies to PC with USB ports which power stays on when the PC is powered off. This leaves a security risk if you forgot to unplug the device.By the way, unlike what one other reviewer stated, there is no way other unauthorized users can access the USB's private data once the fingerprint protection is set. You have to unlock the device with a valid fingerprint before you can reset the password and\/or creating a new account to access the data."}

{"reviewerID":"A300O9HLPSZNVS","reviewText":"REACTION AFTER 7 DAYS OWNERSHIP, April 10 2008The Garmin Nuvi 350 is pretty damn good.  However, it needs more work!PROS: It's the most fun gadget since my first home computer, with a multitude of truly great features.  Despite the 15 cons enumerated below, I'd buy this unit again. Even though the Nuvi 350 may mislead occasionally, it'll tell you how to recover from errors.CONS: I've tested my Nuvi 350 in my home patch asking it to map routes I frequently take, so as to begin understanding its strengths and weaknesses. After seven days of use, I have reached the following conclusions.  [1]  The greatest weakness that I have yet identified is that the user cannot tell the Nuvi to avoid particular roads;  after the Nuvi has plotted a particular route, it allows the user to see a list of all the road names; the Nuvi programmers should add in an option to allow the user to exclude any particular road; in my area this is important because several important highways are under reconstruction and very slow;  [2]  The Nuvi needs to avoid telling users to take  illegal left turns.  At my local Home Depot I asked my Nuvi 350 how to get home.  It gave the right directions except for one major boo-boo: it wanted me to get on US Route 1 and get off at the nearest exit and then 0.1 miles later take a deeply illegal left turn, rather than get off at the second nearest exit and merge properly with traffic; the 350 gave me directions that would have shortened my distance but risked shortening my life or giving me a big fat traffic ticket; [3]  It needs to show actual street names as well as route numbers, when both are competing with each other.  In my area the 350 keeps giving County Route numbers that hardly anyone uses, and omits the street names that the rest of us use. For example it keeps saying \"County Route 531\" when it should be saying \"Main Street -- aka County Route 531\".  Equally bad,  the Nuvi keeps giving only street names when everyone uses route numbers, like instead of saying \"State Highway 27\"  it keeps  giving one of the many local street names taken by State Highway 27 as it meanders through Central New Jersey, such as Lincoln Highway, Middlesex Avenue,  Georges Avenue, Lake Avenue, Essex Avenue, Raritan Avenue, to name a few, which are seldom used in everyday parlance; the only solution is to present both names in the text to speech and on the screen;  [4.1]  Sometimes the Nuvi is too late in telling me when to turn;  also, when it gets close to a turn, it often gives poor estimates of distance: it will say 500 feet when in fact the turn is only 100 feet away;  [4.2] sometimes the names of upcoming streets are not visible on the map until after one has passed them; (5)  As another reviewer pointed out, the TomTom  on its main map page tells the user well in advance whether the next turn is right or left, whereas on the nuvi 350, you have to go to a subsidiary page;  this can be very important driving on multilane highways, where it's important to get into the correct lane early on; [6] In driving along local streets in Central New Jersey, about 20 per cent of the side street names did not show up at all, presumably reflecting slow updating or incomplete work by MapSource.  [7]  Garmin should follow TomTom in letting users notify the network  whenever they see a road is out of service or  the  map is out of date; obviously there should be controls on this to defeat  silly pranks, maybe via confirmation through local police or road departments; also, mark suspected blockages as \"reported\" until confirmed by credible witnesses;  [8] I would like the option to constantly display the name of the street I am currently driving on, along with all the official names or route numbers of the street.  [9]  a really bad feature is that the battery is not replaceable: it seems that when the battery goes bad, throw your unit away; this is unlike the competing TomTom One, 3rd edition, which has cheaply replaceable batteries  !!  [10]  The list of FAQs on the Garmin website is pathetically weak... only 10 questions answered. [11] I'd like a constantly available battery indicator; [12] There are two jacks on my Nuvi 350, that allow battery charging and also communication with a computer; the cigarette lighter cable links to either of these; so does the USB cable from the computer. It's not made quite clear whether it's okay to use either cable  on either jack; [13]  There's some flat out careless programming, where up\/down scroll buttons are provided on pages where no scrolling is allowed;  [14] The first part of the  \"Where to page\" is a grab bag of high priority navigation icons (address, my locations, spell name) and low priority icons; (food, lodging, fuel). On page 2 of the \"Where to\" menu is a very high priority navigation icon, \"Intersections\", that ought  to be on page 1.Well, these are my observations after one week of ownership.  In New Jersey,  street signs are very often too small or are hidden by foliage, or faded, or else entirely absent, so that it is easy to get lost when traveling in unfamiliar territory.  I expect my 350 to be a valuable partner with MapQuest in keeping  me reasonably efficient in getting from A to B. I would prefer perfection, but it will be enough to avoid  becoming disastrously lost as has happened several times in the past."}

(as compared to only getting five hours out of a complete discharge)I even tested how far the kit would reach while sill working. Mine stayed connected to about 30 feet away (not that I would ever need to be that far away from the computer but cool none the less)due to the fact that I no longer have a out of control cursor, exceptional range and excellent battery life I am now increasing my rating to 5 stars as I am more than satisfied and with it's current performance."}

The copy may have been slower than seen by the other reviewer since I copied a 640 GB WD Black drive to a 1 TB WD Blue drive.  The 1 TB drive is now a 640 GB drive so you will need a tool like Partition Magic to get it back to 1 TB.Letting the duplication run overnight may not be a good idea.  After doing this, the next morning the destination drive was very hot to touch.  It seems that the drive is not turned off once the copy is complete.  Then again, maybe an evening of spinning and getting hot isn't a problem.I read else where that this unit is very cheaply made therefore I was surprised to find that it actually seems to be made pretty well.

Which makes it as wide open to hacking as my nexus. Its also about as close to vanilla Android as it comes wth out being a nexus. Asus has just added some widgets and apps. They did change the task bar out with a custom one. But you can even switch back to the default one in the setting.Now the reason I took a star away. I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port. I have the USB adapter but its not great. The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode. Its located on the top if your holding it in landscape mode. Which means you have to hold it at a weird angle if you don't use it in landscape. To make it worse most video chat apps seem to be made for portrait mode. It also has a bit of a problem surfing the net. It has a slight lag here and there. Setting flash to not load by default seems to help. But this lag is the least of my worries since Asus is pretty good at updating. And I'm sure they'll address the web browser in the next update.But all and all I like it its a good price. And I'll like it even more when the custom gone hit."}

Easy to carry and I'm letting my 11 year old put it through its paces.  So far there was one glitch when it was updating where the laptop froze completely.  We had to unplug it and remove the battery to bring it back up.  Fortunately, we haven experienced that since.You shouldn't judge a laptop by the operating system.  I'm a bit down on Windows 8, especially on a non-touchscreen, but the daughter has no real issues using it and I've recently gotten some self-paced windows 8 training material that should make things a bit easier.  We haven't activated the cloud storage feature yet.  If we do, I'll come back and update the review.  The sound quality, graphics quality and battery life all meet my expectations for a laptop in this price range.  The large hard drive should also add to its effective service life.Overall, this is a good piece of equipment that should service my daughter's entertainment and educational needs for several years to come."}

I don't see pixelation or delays on any of the HDTV monitors.  There IS about a 3-4 second delay when ANY of the devices are turned off... so if I turn off DEVICE #1.. the other two HDTVs pause (black) then immediately resume the image.  This isn't a problem for me... and I don't know why it happens... but considering how hard it is to find ANY working HDMI splitter... I won't trade this for some letter model.  I still give 5 stars.

{"reviewerID":"A2C5VLIJMDPWHI","reviewText":"Pros: In a loud, busy work environment, sometimes it can be incredibly difficult to have a moment of silence to focus. I have put these earphones in my ear, without playing any music or other sound, just to tune out the background noise and they definitely do the trick. I can't hear much of anything around me because of the noise-isolating ear attachments, which is a great thing for peace of mind. The soft cushions easily fit into my ears and although they're firm enough to not pop out, they're also comfortable.Cons: The problem with the headphones is related to the con. Because it's so easy to tune out background noise, I hesitate to wear these while walking down the street. It's too easy to get distracted and can be a safety hazard. If I can't hear what's going on around me because of the headphones, that's a problem, so I strongly recommend people only using these in safe environments. Not a problem, right? The only real problem I had with these were that the larger cushions were uncomfortable in my ears. I prefer soft ear cushions, and although it says XXS to L and the box says it fits small ears, I feel like I just got out of the swimming pool with these things on. I constantly want to either pop my ears or yank them out because they're entirely too far into the ear. I've worn ear cushions before so it's not a matter of wearing this style. I just don't find the larger cushions to be comfortable, although the smaller ones are. The odd thing is I have a similar pair of headphones that use the larger cushions, and I have no problem at all. They'reIfrogz EarPollution Plugz - Headphones ( in-ear ear-bud ) - black, red, and since they don't go as far into my ear, the larger cushion isn't an issue. I actually like that brand\/version better than these.Also, the computer volume up\/down doesn't work. I tried several times to increase\/decrease the volume, and it didn't work. I also tried this product for my cell phone and mp3 player. It didn't work for those either so be careful about compatibility before you shell out money thinking you're going to use these headphones everywhere.But on the upside, as long as I have the smaller cushions, that's what counts!"}

{"reviewerID":"A1EE9J3T1GOVF5","reviewText":"So after a weekend at a racetrack in the desert i learned sand gets in everything. It was my second day out with a DSLR and was about to just wipe the sand off the lens with my shirt and lucky for me someone stopped me. Sand will scratch the glass. They then told me to buy some a couple UV filters for harsh conditions like this, if it gets ruined it is only a few bucks vs couple hundred or more for a lens.So I took his advice and bought these. Now outdoors in bright sunlight taking pictures of animals and cars.. the pics come out good as far as I can tell.  But in low light indoors with things like candles, small lamps, etc.. there is lots of ghosting and i guess what could be called haze.So if you need  cheap protection for a day outside when you are going to pass your camera around or have the elements flung at you. These work - OK at best. Professional eyes will say they are not much better than a sheet of glass, or so I have read in multiple UV filter comparisons.I have now read the articles about how dust, grime, (even small pieces of tape) on the front element is hardly noticeable in pictures to most people. So if the pictures need to be nice, drop the protective filter concept and use your lens how it was ment to be used.But when I am out taking 1K shots at a racetrack in the desert, having dirt flung at me from dirt bikes, or mud from dirt oval cars.. I will keep the filter on in daylight. If mud gets on the front it is a quick swap to another UV filter instead of cleaning(I carry 2).So yeah you get what you pay for, they do protect.. but just think when it is really needed or not.Side note - I only have 2 lenses the 18-55mm kit lens that came with my D5100 and a refurbished 55-200mm VR that I got for $130..  I really do not need to worry so much about my glass. If I spend big money on a lens and want to protect it, I will order the highest quality filters for it. Why buy a nice lens if you are going to throw a low cost filter on the front? Why not just use a cheap lens then?"}

Very pleased Anker's batteries.Description of use - I would recommend watching some videos on youtube on how to replace the battery before you try it out yourself. Anker assumes a certain amount of technical knowledge on your part and does not include installation instructions. That said, installing the new battery was really easy. The only comment I have about the actual installation process is make sure to actually plug in the battery to the computer. I initially forgot to connect the battery into the computer when I was doing the replacement and so even though the battery was in the computer, it wouldn't turn on. My bad. When I properly plugged in the battery to my computer everything worked great! I am very impressed with Anker's product line.Ideal users - Anker's MacBook Pro battery is for anyone looking for a good replacement battery at an excellent price.Summary of overall impression - I was very satisfied with the performance of this battery. It is comparable to the original battery at half the price. Also, the supplied screwdrivers are invaluable. Apple uses a different screw head on the battery screws. Anker's screwdriver worked great to remove the two unique screws that hold the battery in place.Note based on other user's reviews - Be careful. There are very small screws holding the back of your MacBook Pro in place. Don't over tighten them."}

{"reviewerID":"A2ENU7RB48VUF5","reviewText":"First, I generally don't write reviews for products I didn't purchase  on Amazon - but this was an emergency purchase to replace a GPS stolen from my vehicle and I needed something fast to complete my vacation. Plus, I feel I must post a warning about the almost total lack of Tech Support from Garmin.I'm not a GPS rookie.  I've had several Garmin units and I've been pleased - but that's probably because I never attempted to call Tech Support.The Nuvi 1300 had some nice features compared to my old Garmin but I could not get the trip computer to register elapsed miles and a few other minor things. I looked online but never found answers to my questions.  I never tried to register or update maps and based on information from other reviews, I'm glad I didn't add that frustration to my travel plans!  But I did attempt to call Tech Support which should have another name - maybe Anti-Tech-Support.The support agent might have been a good one if I had ever spoken to him or her - but after 36, 48, and 47 minutes (respectively) on hold (twice being disconnected by their phone system), I gave up.  I was eating up cell phone minutes and wasting vacation time.ADVICE: If you need a GPS, this might be a good one and the price is ever so right.  Get it before you leave home and try it out.  Make sure you do your registration and map updates before you leave.  Password protect the unit so it can't be use without a password.  AND, do not leave it in your car when valet parking - or any other time for that matter.  People will steal them to use, sell, or find their way to your home while they know you are away (refer back to the password protection sentence).Having never had another brand of GPS, I can't say Garmin's Tech Support is the worst but it's hard to believe anyone else's could be worse."}

{"reviewerID":"A2KO62DCXXULDY","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that this is a decent way to access files without needing a computer on all the time.  While you can buy drives that connect to your computer for less money, you will need a computer on that will give you access to them.  This device can be accessed via an iPad, iPhone, or laptop as long as it has access to wifi or your router.  The unit itself is shaped similar to a Slingbox HD, which it sits on in my bedroom, but it is a bit smaller.Personally, setting up this unit was pain free and only took about five minutes.  I plugged it in to my network and a power socket, then installed the software.  I was up and running in no time.  While this unit is not a replacement for NAS boxes that run separate drives and RAID configurations, it is useful to backup hard drives you have plugged into a computer.  There are benefits to just backing up when compared to running RAID.  As an example, your RAID box could have issues that would make it impossible to access any of your files.  While most NAS boxes make it possible to pull the hard drives, with some of them, you need the software on the NAS box to access data on those boxes.  As a result, you may not be able to access files until you get the box fixed.  With a simple backup plan using a drive like this, you avoid this issue. You would only need to worry about everything in the house being fried at the same time.  I placed my Seagate in a separate room, so it connects to a different outlet which may help avoid this type of problem.Once I got the Seagate up and running, I copied over about 500GB of Apple lossless files to the music folder.  I also copied over a 24\/96 FLAC file and a 16\/44.1 WMA lossless file to see how they would be handled via the IOS app.  With media files, it does take some extra processing time to build the Seagate media library (a panel pops up on the iPhone that says \"Buiding Media Library\" during this process).  You can access them via folders during that time, but they become more useful after they are read into the \"Media View\" as \"Album\", \"Songs\", \"Artists\", and \"Playlists\".  If you access the WMA lossless file the player will ask you if you want to download it to play with another player.  I don't believe that I have a player on my iPhone that can handle that format, so I downloaded it, but I am not sure how it would work with other players.  The 24\/96 FLAC file simply says \"unsupported format\" and won't let you do anything with it.Once the media library was setup, I had no problems playing the ALAC files over wifi at home or while away from home.  I did try playing them via cellular and they would play for a while and then they would cut out.  I am not sure that a large enough buffer is built in to recover time during cell dropouts. Also, it could be that the size of the files are too much to handle over cell.  Not sure, but the feature was not usable while driving in my car and playing lossless files.I also copied over jpeg and CR2 (Canon RAW) files to the photo folder.  The iPhone will show the jpeg files.  When you click on one, it will open into a small thumbnail and below the pic is a bar that will show how quickly the entire jpeg is loading.  When the bar is full, the entire picture pops up.  There is also a slideshow feature on iOS.  I should mention that I have an iPhone 4S, so that may slow things down a bit.  However, when I start a slideshow and a music file, the 2 second interval between photos that I had chosen can take quite a bit longer.  Also, the music file might not play or the entire screen may go black.  My jpegs are fairly large and my audio files are lossless, so this may just be too much for the NAS to handle quickly over wifi.  I have also tried in on an iPad 3rd gen and it also chokes on the process.  In other words, if you are planning on using Airplay to send a photo slideshow to an AppleTV, you may be disappointed if you have similar sized (2 MB+) photos and lossless audio files.  My CR2 files show up as an unsupported format on the iPhone.I also copied over several M4V files to the video folder.  On wifi via the iPad, you click on a video and you get a icon showing that something is happening in the background.  Depending on the file size and wifi speed, this can take a while to load.  As an example, I have a 2.6 GB file that I recorded using Eyetv.  It started playing after a couple minutes, but it caught up with the buffer after a fews seconds and stopped playing.  A small file will buffer faster, so the usefulness of this feature depends on file size and the time you have to let the buffer build up.  I think it also depends on your wifi speed.  I have noticed that sometimes I can play a file without a hiccup and other times it chokes up.  I tested it using a cellular connection on my iPhone 4S, but if you try to play the file, it will say that it can't stream the file and it will download it instead.  You can pause or cancel the download.  Obviously, you would want to be careful downloading GBs of data depending on your cellular plan, so I don't think I would use this very often.One of my favorite features is the ability to copy iPhone or iPad media contents to the drive.  This is very useful for photos because you get a local backup of the files and you can delete them from the iOS device.  While Apple's Photostream will do this, too, there are limitations on the number of photo files they will store at one time.  Currently, Apple will accept 1000 of your latest files, so I like the idea of just backing up my iPhone to an ethernet attached drive.  While I haven't been on vacation since I got the Seagate drive, I think this feature will come in handy to copy over photo files via wifi while I sleep.To summarize, this is an inexpensive alternative to a NAS that gives you access to files while away from home.  Some of the features aren't perfect, but depending on your use, having access to the files can be very beneficial.  I mainly use it for audio when on wifi, and it excels at that even using lossless files.  The photo feature is also nice if you want to show someone a photo that isn't on your iPad\/iPhone.  If this device was more expensive and competed with normal NAS devices, my review would have been more critical of the features that did not work very smoothly.  However, for the money, I am not sure there is anything like it, which may help explain my 4 star rating."}

My rankings for the features of this product go in the orderAmazing\/mind blowing display.One cannot take eyes of it (dint face any issue as one of the reviewers had mentioned about the strain). Watching Hulu or iTunes trailers \/ your own pictures or videos is so sharp and clear. After getting used to this you wudnt want to go to any laptop. This is something that happened to me after getting the iPad with retina display as well :)The sleek\/slim n sexy design (everyone knows how sleek MacBooks are..so nothing new)Super fast booting.I am amazed with the way it boots up and also the instant wake up from sleep.I hear almost all the pcs or ultrabooks do the same now a days. But well this is the first experience for me as such.Really fast response browsing through or multi tasking.Camera for FaceTime video or taking pictures.This is one aspect I am little disappointed.I don't find the camera that good. When checked at the apple store the picture from the MacBook's camera seemed really good, but here It's slightly blurry and unclear.I was hoping to do FaceTime from my MacBook Pro as well. I guess I will just have to take pics or FaceTime from iPad or iPhone.The BatteryLittle disappointed with this as well. I did not see the expected 7 hrs battery life.So far I may have got only 3-4 hrs battery life If I am not wrong. May be as I use it longer the battery life would improve.And  the fact that now all your apple devices stay synced is one of the important points or factors one may want to get a MacBook. (Not necessarily this expensive MacBook)So far I have not faced any other issues what someone had quoted.I will update my review in next few days after I work on it for a week more.I have taken out one star ..for the disappointing camera and battery life."}

{"reviewerID":"A3NKYJCQBSA4LU","reviewText":"***UPDATE 10\/21\/13***This unit is just amazing, and I want people to know. It has worked flawlessly with 2 different motherboards, and the speeds are better than competing USB 3.0 readers (see user images http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-media\/product-gallery\/B00B7ID99I\/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_txt - you will notice that the highest reading is the picture I posted using this card reader).I also want to stress that I use this in a production environment. Each week I record almost an entire 64GB card full of HD video, take numerous pictures, etc. This card reader really gets put through its paces with me and has held up exceptionally well.I just couldn't say enough good about this reader. I do wish it came with a 5 1\/4\" bay adapter so I didn't have to buy one separately, but that's minor. Not to mention it would be worthless to most people I'm sure. If the reader fails or acts up in any way I'll be sure to update this post, but I don't anticipate that happening.*** END UPDATE***Of all of the upgrades I recently purchased to improve the speed and effectiveness of my workflow when editing videos, this by far has made the biggest impact.I used to wait an entire afternoon every week for a 2 hour HD recording to transfer from my camera to my PC. Not anymore... With this baby, I can download my video at 70MB\/s (the max speed of the card). It's also extremely useful to have your memory card reader right there on the front of your PC so you don't have to waste desk space for a separate unit. Finally, the added USB 3.0 port on the front just tops it all off to be an amazing item.I looked literally for hours for this little guy. I was shocked at how difficult it was to find a true USB 3.0 card reader that mounted in a front bay on the PC. You have to be careful too, there was one that I almost got that was labeled USB 3.0 because it had a USB 3.0 slot, but the card reader itself operated at 2.0 speeds.This one is the real deal, and the price is exceptional for what you get. I would recommend this to everyone who uses memory cards!"}
{"reviewerID":"A19W77ITO6I1CN","reviewText":"The bear extender does exactly what is says it will do - extend your wifi range and strengthen your signal.My home office is 57ft away from my wireless router (dual band AC type) and before I bought this I was getting between 2-3 bars (windows 8.1 desktop computer). My old download speed was a crappy 3.62mbps and now I get 11.5mbps - same as being wired directly to the router. My downloads and streaming content is really fast now. This was well worth the small price!This adapter comes with two antennas (small and large) to fit your needs depending on your distance from your router. I tried both and ended up using the larger one (got a tiny speed gain over using the little one). It also comes with a short (about 2ft) usb cord so you can place it next to your computer. I used a 6 ft cord so I could put it on top of a shelf in my office for a better signal.This is very easy to set up. Just follow the quick instructions included in the box and you are up and running in 15 minutes.The only downside is they don't make this for routers that broadcast a 5ghz signal yet. It just runs on a 2.4ghz signal, but for me, that is ok.I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants better wifi signals in rooms that are far away from the router or who use a laptop in parks or other public places."}
{"reviewerID":"A1A9AFW68VI907","reviewText":"I purchased this card after borrowing a card with an identical product number from a friend. My friend's card worked out of the box with my version of Ubuntu Linux.When I received my card, it simply did not work. After doing some research, I found that I had a card with a different version number, and a different chipset. My friend's card had a chipset made by Atheros, which worked out of the box. The card that I purchased had a Broadcom chipset, which is notorious for being incompatible with Linux. Even after going to the forums, I was unable to make the card work.Belkin is dishonest, in that it makes changes to the chipset without changing the product number, only the version number, which the consumer is not made aware of. Had I been aware that the card had a different chipset, I would not have ordered it."}

I toyed with the idea of getting the Sena cover which cost about $70 more but when I cam across this I had to check it out.  One thing to note is I wish this had a pocket for business cards like the Sena cover.  My biggest concern is that inside where you insert the keyboard has an edge that I worry will scratch the screen over time.  This worries me.  Let face it if you shell out the money for a MacBook Air you want to take good care of it.  I'm gonna have to think about this.  At this time I'm thinking of returning it.

I travel frequently to Europe and Asia and wanted something that would power my iPod on the flight (10 hours to Germany, 20 to Korea), and used batteries I could find anywhere.I threw away the generic AA's that came in a package and use Energizers or Duracells.  I've never had a lock up, or had the unit overheat.  It powers my iPod for about 22 hours at reasonable volume levels.The only negative is that it doesn't accomodate my iPod in a hardshell case, so I've resorted to holding the whole thing together with a couple of rubber bands.  Not pretty, but effective."}

{"reviewerID":"A3DJSJ4KQ43TOM","reviewText":"I own a half dozen of the old USB 2.0 Patriot 64GB Magnum USB flash drives and they are pretty dang good and have only had one performance failure requiring an RMA over about two years and consistent use.  This new usb 3.0 version is the same form factor, which is to say its big, although not as big as the 64gb 1.5\" USB\/eSATA external SSD it is replacing from Transcend which started developing a ton of errors recently right outside it's warranty period.  I wouldn't want to put this in my pocket full time due to it's size.  It is an an aluminum enclosure, but the end cap is only held in by some plastic tabs and one of my old sticks the end has broken off exposing the circuit board and chips inside... you can actually slide the whole memory module board out completely of the aluminum case if this happens.  However, my sticks are well used and it is unlikely a normal person would break their flash drive in this manner.The speed of this flash drive is very fast for large files.  As a test, I copied a 2GB HD video clip to the drive (write performance) and was getting around 120MB\/sec throughout the transfer from my SSD - total transfer time was ~19 seconds!  My platter 1.5TB HD could only manage around 60 MB\/sec sustained to this drive.. this USB stick is FASTER than my 1.5TB hard drive for large file transfers!  Also, this patriot magnum is faster than my Adata aluminum usb 3.0 32gb stick.Lost a Star: I actually use this drive in the \"real world\" to transfer JPEG photos averaging 2-3MB in size.  Here the flash drive falls short and loses a star.  I could only attain a max of about 33MB\/sec sustained transfer WRITE speed.  I tried both NTFS and exFAT and many different allocation sizes.  I tried from both my SSD and my external SATA RAID 5 array.  Even my 1.5TB hard drive managed 40+MB\/sec write speed transferring the same files.Reading the JPEG photos from the drive is a completely different story, luckily.  I was able to get around 135-145MB\/sec sustained reading from the flash drive writing to the SSD.  That is totally awesome and beyond my hopes for read speed.Are you ready for this?  Transferring the 2GB HD video clip to the SSD I got 215-230MB\/sec sustained.  Whaaaat?!  Awesome!Other thoughts:No, there is no activity LED - True, the USB 2 version had it, but not this one, which is odd.No, there is no Lanyard included - I added my ownYes, the Cap falls off easily - will be lost in no time... I lost the caps in no time from all my other Magnum drives and it doesn't make a difference one bit.  Through all our hard use there have been no problems with the exposed USB connector.Edit May 6, 2014Changed from 4 stars to 3 since the drive just died.  In the RMA process with Patriot now.  Their low level format software didn't do anything.  Windows showed the drive as \"2301 boot rom device\" and could not access it."}

{"reviewerID":"A8M5WJ8H1K4T7","reviewText":"I bought a pair of these headphones for use in my walking and jogging exercise routines. I use them with an iPhone 4s. Mine seem to skip out the audio a fair amount. I suspect this may have something to do with GPS. That's what comes to mind anyway. I don't really know why they drop audio. I could try them with GPS off and see what happens just to see.Aside from the above, I'm someone who buys the Apple headphones with the play\/pause forward\/backward mic on the cable so I can skips songs, talk to Siri or make\/receive a call. However, when you constantly jog or do intense cycling with the Apple ear-buds it seems to me that a little sweat on those headphones kills the controls. They just flat out stop working. I can say that I order them from Amazon a lot. I tend to buy 4 replacement headphones at a time, which gets expensive. I carry an extra pair in my laptop bag. I have a few extra pairs at the office and home. Just yesterday another pair died on me.So anyway...  my thinking is to go wireless. If I sweat on these there is nowhere for it to go really. When you see the image of these you'll understand. Today I did 2 miles run and then a 1,500 foot incline over 3 miles. Get my heart rate as high as 163. Having the right music keeps me going. Any the last thing I want is something that feels awkward and takes me out of my oneness with the road, the wind and my workout. These headphones are almost invisible to my attention. The collar goes pretty much unnoticed. And the cables going from the collar to the ear buds are long enough that you can twist your head in any direction without ever feeling a wire touch your neck.Back to Apple's ear buds for a second. One of the biggest problems with ear buds, is that as you jog your arms sway in and out building momentum for your body. Wired ear bud cables can sometimes get yanked right out of your ear when the cable gets in the path of a swaying fist. And this of course isn't a pleasant feeling. It happens at home too. Once in a while I pass an open door and find my ear yanked hard because the cord of a head phone gets caught on the passing doorknob.Don't like the seemingly random cutting out, but I'll take that over corded headphones. Maybe someone should make WiFI sport headphones for joggers. It was actually pretty difficult to find a pair of headphones that looked like they'd be suitable for jogging.  So far these seem the most suitable.Update 8-11-2012I have changed from the iPhone 4s to the Samsung Galaxy SIII. And guess what... The headphones don't cut out anymore. Well, as long as I leave the phone in an arm holster, the signal is strong. I find that if I put the phone in my back pocket, then the headphones cut out. And standing close to a microwave oven also causes drop outs.I'm now using these headphones for running, the trip to and from work and walking. I upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars."}

When I ordered my new iPod, I ordered the iFrogz Touch Luxe case with it and from the first second out of the package, my new unit has remained in perfect condition. Plus this cover is very cool, easy to handle and protects my iPod without slipping off or getting hung on items in my pocket or bag like the neoprene covers.I'll never buy another iPod without also having one of these. Also as a bonus that was not well documented was the fact that the iFrogz unit came with a screen protector in the package. I have already been through that one and wish I could find their brand of screen protectors on Amazon because they are better than the others I have received in other orders."}

{"reviewerID":"A1B6YAUB3VLAD5","reviewText":"My first CD player was a Harman Kardon, bought in 1990, and it served me well for nearly 10-years. In the intervening years I've bought fewer CDs and played them on a DVD player, but increasingly downloaded music in AAC or MP3. But these compressed formats are just not that good, and lately I have developed a passionate hatred of the restrictions imposed by the Digital Rights Management (DRM) associated with such media. So it was time to go back to solid, tangible media where I know where I stand as regards where I can and can't legally play it.Next question; where to buy? I did what would make most audio-evangelists splenetic with grief. I bought my HD990 and a Harman Kardon receiver (HK3490) from Amazon, without having even listened to them. Why? Over the years I have suffered buying audio equipment from up-market Hi-Fi dealers. I'm over being treated like an ignorant peasant because I'm not prepared to spend $1000 on a cable. Audio equipment obeys a law of diminishing returns. A $5000 CD player does NOT sound ten times better than a $500 one. Maybe spending that much money just makes you want to believe it does?Not surprisingly, the HD990 has 100% fulfilled my expectations. It was dead simple to set up. The front panel controls and remote control are simple, and elegantly designed. There are both analog outputs and digital (optical and coaxial) outputs. I'm using analog because cable distance to the receiver is very short. You even have the option of exporting playback to another DA converter, but I'm not sure why you'd want to do this.And the sound is just lovely. There is no transport noise during quiet passages. Listening to a selection of R&B;, jazz and rock, I think it handles acoustic better than electric, but then this could be my speakers.Well done HK, and well done Amazon for the keen price."}

{"reviewerID":"A16YWT4XJTOWQV","reviewText":"I went ahead and spent the extra $500 bucks based on the Nikon reputation for a reliable quality product which could be used in the field for years to come.  After a little over 6 months of pampered use, the autofocus on this lens just stopped working altogether for no apparent reason.  Being the first Nikon product I have owned, I was not impressed.  The image quality however was quite nice and very wide at 12mm.  I never experienced any vignetting, but lots of flare when pointed anywhere near the sun.  I got the auto focus fixed under warranty and ended up trading it in for a little over $500 dollars considered in EX+ condition.  So I'm learning.  I'm done wasting my money on overpriced equipment.  Unless you are independently wealthy or get free gear from Nikon I would get a Tokina or Sigma instead.  If anything good comes out of this, it is that I used this lens in trade toward a Mamiya RB67 body and back, which looks like is going to be a lot of fun :) enjoy."}

Why on earth did they not allow the batteries to be recharged while installed in the camera? The feature of my old simple Easy-Share camera which recharges and can be downloaded when placed on its stand is totally missing. The batteries must be removed and placed in a charger that, for some reason, has destroyed two batteries so far. To make matters worse, the batteries can not even be charged in the camera using a wall-wart (power supply) or the USB cable. My second complaint is that in video mode, while quality is high, the format used is .mov, the Apple QuickTime format rather than one of the many formats that can be played by Windows Media Player. Therefore, before editing in a Windows PC the format has to be converted using commercial software. Last, I am a person who likes the option to control a camera using manual settings. This camera has these capabilities, but the use of them is very poorly documented.To sum it up, I give the picture and zoom lens a five star rating but am disgusted with the inconvenience of replacing spent batteries and the poor documentation."}

{"reviewerID":"A342PAZ5NSQRM3","reviewText":"I frequently switch between taking handwritten notes and using my Nexus 7 tablet in meetings and I find that a combination pen and stylus is a great convenience for me.  This stylus from Kensington works very well in both applications. It's a stylish pen that writes very smoothly and feels solid in my hand and as a stylus it gets the job done too.  Some reviewers questioned how to replace the pen refill.  Actually it's quite easy.  While you must twist the pen body to open or close it for writing, to replace the refill you pull the cap off, exposing the refill inside.  The refill then unscrews and is easily replaced.  I think the problem people are having is that the cap fits tightly onto the base and you have to exert some effort to separate the two parts. But to me that means this pen is solidly built and that's a positive.There are plenty of similar products on the market and many of them cost a bit less than this pen\/stylus. But this one looks and feels like a much more expensive pen.  And the price on Amazon is discounted enough to make it a better value.If you want a pen\/stylus that works well in both modes and looks and feels great then give this product a try!"}

{"reviewerID":"AZHQ8VYRE0383","reviewText":"Please Note: The reviews for the 26\", 32\", and 40\" flavors of this TV are all mixed together, which may cause confusion for readers when comparing features.  My review is for the 40\" size.Pros:1) Excellent 1080P picture quality2) Price ($400 tax free + free Prime shipping)3) Variety of inputs (including a VGA and audio input for connecting a computer)4) S\/PDIF output (e.g., for a home theater system)5) The TV speakers are actually decent for an LCD form factor.Cons:1) PS3 will only work on HDMI port #2.  Phillips up-converting DVD-player\/audio-receiver (home theater system) will only show picture on either HDMI port #2 or #3, but not HDMI port #1.  I'm sure there must be some logical explanation for this.  I'm just not sure what HDMI port #1 is for.2) The picture in this Amazon listing, showing the input and output connections for this TV, incorrectly shows a round type (e.g., coaxial) S\/PDIF port.  It is actually a fiber optic connector (i.e., TOSLINK).  I had ordered the wrong audio cable with this TV because of this.3) 60Hz refresh rate.  I personally don't notice any difference between 60Hz and 120Hz, so this didn't matter to me.  My PS3 games even look great.  I'm only listing it as a con, because it might matter to those more sensitive to these refresh rates.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase! For what you are getting for $400, this is a great value! I really am impressed with the picture quality.  It even looks better than some of the more expensive LCD TVs on display at my local electronics store.  I bought this TV for my 12'x12' apartment living room and it meets my needs nicely! I would definitely buy again and recommend to a friend."}

I had this happen to me a few years ago and was devastated at the files I lost, especially the photos I had been storing on my computer.  Ever since that day I have tried my best to back everything up.  The problem, however, is actually making the effort to back up the files.  To say the least, it can get tedious and if you slip up, it's easy to get out of the habit.Apple has fixed this problem with their Time Capsule.  I've been waiting for the new version and picked one up the day it came out.  This version is taller than their older model, and hardly takes up any desk space.  We have ours in the office and this thing is unobtrusive.Set up is a breeze.  I plugged this straight into my cable modem.  The set up software on the Mac takes you step-by-step through the process of setting up the Wi-Fi signal and also configuring the Time Machine software to begin automatically backing up your computer's hard drive.  The first back up will take a long time, but after that the software will update the backup on the Time Capsule in just a few minutes, all automatically and in the background.  The other nice thing is that it's possible to set up the Time Capsule to back up two different computers.  I did this with my own and my wife's MacBook Pros, the setup couldn't be easier.So far, I couldn't be happier with the set up.  The Wi-Fi signal is strong and has handled two computers, an iPad, and a Tivo all at the same time with no hiccups.  Unlike our previous router, I haven't found any dead spots in our house yet.  Luckily, I haven't had to use the back-up function, but I feel much more at ease knowing it is there and will stay current no matter how lazy I get.There are three gigabit internet connections on the back for plugging in devices directly.  We have an AppleTV plugged in and the wired connection results in much better streaming that over Wi-Fi.  We also plugged our older printer into the USB slot to enable wireless printing.  Now any computer can wirelessly print to one printer without having to upgrade to a newer printer with built-in wireless connectivity.Like everything else they do, Apple excels are creating well-honed systems that run simply and flawlessly.  With the Time Capsule, they've taken away the hassle of backups forever.  I think every Apple user should get a Time Capsule.  If you don't back up, I can promise one day you will regret it.  Save yourself the nightmare and get a Time Capsule!"}

{"reviewerID":"A345XOQZWYOXSN","reviewText":"These people really know how to build cases. Solid, tight construction, quality materials. I even like their minimalist and well designed packaging. I had already purchased one of their other iPad stands --Slim iPad 3 case: The Ridge by Devicewear - Black Vegan Leather New iPad Case with Six Position Flip Stand With On\/Off Switch (Compatible with 3rd Generation iPad and iPad 2), which was also great. Only problem (well, more a lack of a feature) was dealing with sites that are portrait oriented or wanting to read iBooks in that orientation. So, when I saw this model, I thought I'd give it a try.It's another beautifully made case and the ability to rotate is certainly handy. There are only 2 viewing angles, but they serve my purposes and the ridges they sit in holds the iPad nicely in place. OK angle for typing, not great. Accepting that no case is going to hit everyone's wish list, I only gave this 4 stars (instead of 5) because of the bulk that the rotating ring creates. It makes the case considerably thicker and heavier than my first one.Still and all, a fine case that delivers on its promise and gives you a real sense of protection for your 'Pad."}
{"reviewerID":"A3USFLSMLH7OUL","reviewText":"I bought to use as a big, high res monitor for 2D cad work.  It can be a bit tricky to get computer to drive since it requires HDMI 1.4 -- otherwise the best that can be achieved is 19Hz.  Just make sure to set sharpness down to 0.Might not be great to game at native resolution - 30Hz likely too slow for twitch games.  Its fine if you feed it 1080p, but if thats the sole purpose, might as well get a lower resolution set.When I've played with it as a TV, I've been less impressed - I have no source of 4k content, and the results of upscaling from 1080p or other resolutions don't blow my socks off.

{"reviewerID":"A2FSOHSM9X13JT","reviewText":"I have been shooting with theNikon D60 10.2MP DSLRfor a year and a half and have been more than satisfied with the results. It originally came with the 18-55 lens and I also got a 55-200 but those were upgraded toNikon 18-105mm Zoom LensandNikon 70-300mm Zoomover the past year. I have now had the D5100 for four weeks, received for a milestone birthday, and I absolutely love it. For me it provided everything I needed without having to reach up to the D7000.The image captures from the D5100 using either the 105 or the 300 are very very high quality. The D5100 has the same image sensor as the D7000, which is a nice benefit. When I go out to shoot, I shoot. It is nothing to snap two or three hundred clicks in very short order. And very few of them do I ever have to delete while still on the memory card in the camera or discard later once downloaded to my pc or laptop.The settings and functions are easy to learn and easy to use. The additional \"Scenes\" and \"Effects\" I am still playing with but the ones I have used have delivered as Nikon promises. I still do an awful lot of landscape photography, as well as sunrise and sunset images, and the D5100 executes exceedingly well with both the 105 and 300. Very rarely do I ever end up with an under- or over-exposed image regardless of the setting or function that I use.As mentioned in my D60 review I enjoy the use of a viewfinder and even though the D5100 has liveview I still now prefer the viewfinder. Of course, using the built-in \"Selective Color\" function means I have to use liveview and that is fine. And, speaking of which, selective color works just great. I have experimented with it on various types of scenes, all hand-held without a tripod, and the results are quite remarkable considering the unit snaps two photos. That, in itself, says much about Nikon's VR capabilities.I greatly enjoy the 3\" display, over my D60's smaller one. Not just for the size, but the color clarity is superb. The addition of the articulating display was brilliant on Nikon's part as it assists framing difficult shots with relative ease.The performance of the D5100 in low-light situations, with either the 105 or 300, is outstanding. I have not yet experimented with the \"Active D-Lighting\" function that works to improve the dynamic range between low and high light, so cannot address that. Once I have done so, I shall update my review.As a final note, I am, at this point, keeping my D60, and have the 105 on one of the cameras and the 300 on the other because I just hate to take the time to change a lens and I do still get great images from the D60. However, depending on what I plan to shoot the D5100 gets first choice of lens and the D60 takes the backseat.For the money I do not think the D5100 can be beat for quality of performance."}

I have over 30 watches, in all different styles, sized weights and prices, i have never seen a watch band like this one, the band is actually aluminum link shells that have a silicone piece that holds the pins in between each link. This does 2 things, first is means that against the skin is the very soft silicone pieces and the watch band does not move around on your wrist as long as you size it pretty close to what you need. 2 it is incredibly light weight, when i first got it i was actually disappointed at how lightweight it was, it felt a little heavier than an empty soda can. After putting in the Nano (which weighs more than the band) the watch had a really nice feel to it. I have to say that as a watch the nano works pretty good, i wish it would stay on longer but it is not a big deal to push the button to check the time. I am also adding a Bluetooth receiver to it so i can use wireless headphones when I want to work out, i will use this for working out because it just stays put and doesn't move at all on your wrist, and there is a watch module the anTik that is sold to place into this band if you ever get tired of using this with the Nano. the best nano watch band out there!"}

I have had it almost a year and my family and friends all have been impressed with the video quality as well.  I have not taken still shots with this camera so I cannot comment on still shots.  I'm sure if you do your research there are probably several cameras on the market that are as good as this one, perhaps even better(cant' be by much) in this price range, but I have been very happy and very impressed with this camera and would definantly recommend this camera.Note: Since I wrote this review I did notice that outside\/bright lighting the picture is amazing. However, indoors w\/moderate lighting the picture is OK, not bad, but not nealry as sharp as outdoors.  I still recommend doing your research but I am very happy and impressed with this camera."}

It works good for that purpose and I like the aux and usb inputs.  The only thing that I don't like is the radio.  The tuner is very weak and can't even pull in strong stations without static.  The tuner has a digital readout, but it is actually ananalog tuner which is very touchy.  It is very difficult to keep a stationed tuned in.  The telescoping antenna doesn't help much.  Also, the remote only works for CD and MP3 functions, not the radio.  Other than that, everything else works fine and the sound good for a small player."}
{"reviewerID":"A1VK02YYECXMIB","reviewText":"The reason I have given this item such a poor review is hopefully to save someone else a lot of grief when they buy a Zoom H1 digital recorderZoom H1 Handy Portable Digital Recorder.  Immediately below the photo of the Zoom H1 is a section of the web page titled \"Frequently Bought Together\" that lists the Zoom-H1, the Zoom-H1 Accessory Kit, and a \"Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card\".  Since the H1 only comes with 2GB, buying it with extra memory is pretty much expected, though for me 16GB was excessive, so I purchased the 8GB version of the same item.  The problem here is that the Zoom H1 DOES NOT USE SDHC FLASH MEMORY!  It uses ONLY micro-SD or micro-SDHC cards, which are completely different, especially in size.  So anyone who is in a hurry at the time like I was and clicks on the seemingly-helpful \"Add All Three To Cart\" button like I did, before reading in detail all of the device's technical specifications, is going to be in for a rude surprise when their package finally arrives from Amazon.As far as I know, this may be a perfectly acceptable, memory card, if somewhat slow for video or high-resolution photography.  But for a digital audio recorder, it should be perfectly adequate, if only it fit in the device for which it was recommended."}

{"reviewerID":"A3CKIIXNYG3CK7","reviewText":"I read over reviews on Amazon before pulling the trigger on this set. I really needed it for late night PC use while the gf is asleep. I was really disappointed after the 1st nights use.Pros:- The sound has quality. I don't have a very trained ear so listening to headphones always sounds good to me.- Very light weight! Very comfortable to wear.Cons:- Static noise is very apparent. It is setup as my default playback sound on Windows 7. It is very random but when I turn on my PC the headphones blast off with static (fixed after spending 30 seconds to tune the headphone)It isn't very visible, but there is a volume button and a tune button on one side of the headphones. After I tuned correctly, it worked great. I moved 10 ft away from the source, it still sounds very nice, however, small movements of my head would generate static interference. (There aren't any other electronics between myself and the PC)- Started to get very annoying to tune the headphones every time I turned on the headphone set and\/or PC.Result:Returned this item. Sennheiser's other RS headphones may be great but this one definitely is not. Using Logitech G930 now."}

{"reviewerID":"A3I7I0MKM53JUC","reviewText":"When I bought this drive all I wanted was a compact 1 TB drive I could use to backup my data.  Because of the way I handle the backups, I wanted to do this manually, just copy over the folders I wanted to archive.  At first the drive resisted this using the drivers that Windows 7 installed.  I would try to copy over folders and nothing would happen.  Very frustrating.  When I installed the drivers contained on the disk drive, it worked OK.The bottom line is that this drive is designed and configured for you to use the Western Digital software to backup your data.  If that is what you want to do, this may be the right drive for you.  If you simply want an external disk drive, think twice about this one. You can make it work that way for you, but you do have to do some tweaking.  I would prefer one that I can just plug into my computer and have it work out of the box.Here is an update.  I HATE THIS DISK DRIVE.  All I want to do is copy over folders of my photographs (which are large) when I am not using the computer.  It still will not let me copy over large directories.  I think I will try to reformat it and start over.This is a nice, compact drive that seems to mechanically function well, but, software-wise, it will not do what I want it to do.  I have never before had this problem with an external hard drive., At a showing of his photographs, I once asked a professional photographer how he got his pictures so sharp and clear.  His response was that he used top of the line cameras and lenses.  I didn't understand then, I do now.I just received this lens and have not had a lot of time to play with it, but my initial reaction is \"Wow.\"  I own some other lenses that I thought were pretty good (e.g. Canon 24-105 L), but none match the sharpness and clarity of this lens.  In addition, having a lens that gives you f\/2.8 at 200 mm is amazing.  I also just bought a 2X extender to use with the lens.  I will update this as I use the lens more, but, so far it far exceeds expectations."}

{"reviewerID":"ANXEW7IDYDJEH","reviewText":"If you want quiet fans and want to keep your case cool, definitely check out this twin pack!The stock fans in my ThermalTake case were noisy and vibrated due to their direct plastic-on-metal attachment to the case.  Tightening the screws never seemed to help for long, so I finally looked into a better cooling solution.  The rattling of the fans was actually more annoying than the fans on my GTX780!These had good reviews and also had rubber attachment points to help reduce vibration so I was excited to try them out.  My case had a top and side mount that were perfect for these fans.  Just be sure to look for the small directional arrows that show the airflow direction (they're on the edge of the fan, on one side).  Screwing them into the case is a bit &#34;weird&#34; since you're screwing into rubber and it has some &#34;give&#34;, but keep at it and the fans will be securely mounted.After mounting and connecting both, I powered on the PC and was almost wondering if I forgot to connect the power to the fans!  They are super-quiet!I didn't care much for the snap-on color rings, but your mileage may vary there."}

{"reviewerID":"A3AK5A1U0IR79U","reviewText":"As a beginner who never really played with a tablet before, I was torn between getting this one, versus the Genius MousePen 8 x 6-Inch Graphic Tablet for Home and Office by Genius one.  The Genius one was approximately $15 cheaper than this when I bought it, and that one is also larger with a bigger active area.  In the end, I decided to get the Wacom since I know the brand is good, and I figured as a beginner I realy don't need something so large anyway.My decision, thankfully, was excellent.  The Wacom Bamboo is small, but very very sleek looking, and would not look jarring or ugly in any office or home setting.  The active area is small, but unless you're a pro artist needing a large drawing area and a 1024 sensitivity, then you really wouldn't need anything larger than what the Bamboo Small offers.  In fact if you're a beginner artist, getting the Bamboo is an excellent choice.The plug and play capability is excellent: I was able to plug it in, and immediately use the pen as a mouse all over my monitor.  The installation was really just a formality so you can change the pen's capability (which I haven't bothered to touch, as it doesn't seem at all necessary).  Sensitivity level isn't as high as the more expensive Wacom tablets, but again for general use and beginner artist use, it's not all that obvious.  As some people said before, the active area is a little grainy rather than smooth, but unless you've used a smooth surfaced tablet before and is very used to that, then it shouldn't matter all that much.Also because it IS small, I was able to use it on my desk.  I didn't realize until I bought it and received it, how small my desk is.  If I bought the Genius, it would not have fit on my desk.I haven't really used the scroll much except when I draw, so in photoshop at least, it zooms in and out quickly and smoothly.  The buttons too, I didn't realy use, but the Desktop hotkey works well and quickly.The ONLY annoying thing is the pen.  It's fairly light and penlike so holding it is comfortable, however the placement of the buttons are very iffy.  Quite a few times now I would accidentally press on the button while drawing, and things would pop up when i meant to draw something.  It's not a big deal I don't think if you draw using the extremely proper\/correct way to hold pen\/pencil like they try to teach back in elementary school, but unfortunately I have a bad habit of clutching the pen tightly and wrapping my fingers all around the pen (hard to describe), which means usually some part of my hand ends up pressing again the buttons.  Furthermore, I like to twirl my pen aruond in my hand often, which means even if I did place it in a way that doesn't touch the button, very quickly that would change.It's mainly a small thing and I just need to get used to it though.  Overall it's an excellent product for an incredibly low price, and I think this should be the #1 product a beginner artist should use."}

That said, I am assuming you are not a struggling professional trying to shoot a high quality, tight-budget job. You are a user looking for one lens to carry to cover a wide range of service.I'm a pro. I have a many bodies and L lenses to use.I carry an XSI with THIS Sigma 18-200mm non OS lens just about everywhere I go. It is a great vacation tool, where most pix are shown in a digital frame or are never going to be more than 4x6.Yes, the MTF is not great (simply: contrast across the lens), there is some chromatic fringing and watch out! the lens hood will cause vignetting and shadows with a flash at wide angle. I've been using this lens since it was released in early '05.It's a $300 lens. Does it compare to a $1500 L lens? Yeah - very badly. So what? The first rule of photography is get the picture. Missing the shot while changing lenses is not photography. Is this the preferred lens in my arsenal? No. But for general non-client, daylight, non-sports shooting, it's the one I'll probably be using. I prefer the non-optical stabilzed version - less complexity.To help you weigh this review: I use five professional (5D, 1D) and several prosumer (40D, 50D, XTI, XSI) bodies and nine L lenses, plus a slew of others.Photo tip: night shooting of foreground against backround (done a lot with this lens!): typical situation: girl on beach in front of sunset. Manually set exposure to flash shutter speed, aperature & ISO to get background. Turn flash on to expose and meter foreground. You'll get some great \"how did you do that?\" pix. All the MTF, abberetion and linearity issues will mean nothing, because you got a picture no one else could and th L doesn't really add anything, because you want depth of field here.Thanks for reading my review."}

A 3rd friend was busy pilfering my music collection and downloading the songs to his phone. I didn't get a chance to try and stream 5 movies at once, but it handled four people beautifully.I had it running on battery power for a solid 6 hours and the indicator only got to yellow, so I believe it is a safe assumption that the 7 hour battery life they advertise is fair.I did find a few things that I would have liked to be different:The wifi signal isn't very strong, I've found the range is more like 20 ft, not the advertised 30.The on\/off switch is pretty easy to accidentally toggle when transporting the device.Despite what I felt were a few shortcomings I would definitely recommend it to a friend. It has handled being toted around very well, it's small and lightweight. The fact that I can carry around 1tb of information and anyone can connect to it wirelessly, no matter where I am, just blows my mind. It's definitely my favorite new toy.I would recommend downloading the full manual from the corsair website as it explains how to do some slightly more technical things.

{"reviewerID":"A3QWNQ2WA7QZYJ","reviewText":"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE PICTURES AT NIGHT.This is a great pocket digital camera, except for one major, major flaw.  It has a very weak flash.  The spec's on the camera give it a range of 5 feet, which is accurate.  Anything greater than 5 feet, and the pictures come out way too dark.Any good camera will have a flash range of at least 11 feet.  The flash range on this camera is just impractical.  Who takes a picture from only 5 feet away?  All you can get is a picture of a head.Other than the flash, this is an excellent camera.  It takes great daytime shots.  The video is comprabable to other cameras this size.This is also one of the fastest cameras in terms of the shutter delay and the time between shots.  It doesn't turn on quite as fast as some newer cameras, but it is still pretty fast.This is only a 6.1 Mega pixal, and the new standard is 7 (and you can get the over 10).  6 is plenty for most people.  Also, because of the fewer pixals, this camera is faster than most of the newer, 7 pixal cameras.Like many pocket cameras now, this one does not have view finder.  You have to use the LCD screen.  I prefer to use a view finder, but that is probably just because of old habits.In summary, great camera to buy if you only take day time pictures.  Very bad choice if you take in door or night time pictures., Do not buy this to extend the wireless range in your house.  It might help in a large auditorium or hall, where there is a uninterrupted line of site but it does not have much effect in a building with interior walls.I have a remote bedroom, about 20 feet away from where I have my wireless router, which isn't that far. This bedroom was an addition so some of the interior walls used to be exterior walls.  I get a very weak signal from the wireless router to this room, using the standard 2dBi antenna that comes with it.I tried this Hawking 15dBi antenna and did not see any noticeable improvement in the signal to the remote bedroom.  Also, it did not improve signal between floors.  I tried moving the antenna around in the room where I have the router, but that did not seem to have any impact either.To improve LAN access across your house you have several choices (but this antenna is not one of them):-Centrally locate your wireless router (it is hard for me to do, because of the wiring in my house).-Rewire your house with CAT5 cable (yeah, sure).-Buy these ethernet networking systems that use the electric wires in the house for networking.  You just plug the units into an electric socket and hook up your computer through a CAT5 cable (it will cost at least $100, you cannot roam freely around and these systems are slower than the wireless LAN)-Buy a repeater and put it somewhere in the middle of the house.  For the repeater, all you need to do is supply power.  It doesn't need any special wiring.I went the repeater route.  The problem with repeaters is that there currently are no universal repeaters.  You need to buy a repeater that matches with the router you have.  I bought a Buffalo router and repeater.  The concept was great and it worked very well when it worked.  But, my system is not reliable, and I have had to send the router back for repair."}

It wouldn't hold a signal and would constantly recalculate when you're on your course.  It would sometimes have you miles away on another road going in a different direction.  Or miles away driving through the country. WHen you stop, it will spin and recalculate. Or show you driving somewhere on a road miles away.  I did take it to Europre but it was never able to obtain a signal there. I talked to support and they had me update the software to the latest and hard reset it. Made no difference. Weirdly defective I suppose or Garmin has gone waaaay down hill (I've been a Garmin customer for awhile). Returned the product for exchange. New one better be night and day better. Thing made me want to throw it against a brick wall it worked so badly.Based upon my experience, I'd say BEWARE. Maybe I had a weirdly defective one.  Maybe the next one will be better. It would seem some people have had the same experience as I though. Some seem to have a decent experience with this though.  Good luck.*** UPDATE ***  01\/07\/10My replacement unit had the same problems as the first.  I am in the process of trying to have it replaced under the warranty.  Very hard to do with Garmin though - Garmin hold message says expect to wait over 30 minutes.  I have bought another GPS as this one just really does not work.  Guess I'll try and get this one replaced and sell it if I can get one that halfway works.  I wouldn't feel good about selling such a piece of junk as Garmin has sold me - and then swapped it out for another piece of junk.  It's an over $200 paperweight sitting on the shelf..."}

{"reviewerID":"A2M2A980999R5Y","reviewText":"Through the years, I've tried both RF and IR repeaters (I bet I've tried at least 5 different solutions) and I find this one the best so far by a long shot.  The real selling point is the product's immunity to noise.  The closest one I tried before was the Hotlink Pro, but it required aiming the sensor away from the front of the TV so that any IR control signal wouldn't be swamped out by the noise.  It works pretty well and is a little cheaper than this one, but its sensitivity (as you would guess) was pretty bad.  This repeater is remarkably better.You may want to buy dual head emitters if you have more than 4 devices to control.CONCLUSION:If you need an IR repeater, you will not be disappointed by this.  If you buy another, you are either spending too much or you are going to be frustrated by performance.Definitely best in class...5 stars."}

{"reviewerID":"A3CZR6UOXVQSMO","reviewText":"The first question I had about these headphones when I opened the box was, could these earphones that cost almost as much as my iPod Touch be worth the money?And after 15 hours of use I can say yes, DEFINITELY.If you are swapping out your stock Apple ear buds, the first thing you will notice is what you were missing.  The sound is stunning, especially when considering the size.These earphones come with a wide range of silicone in-ear buds to fit almost anyone and several of those little blue levers you see in the picture.  The levers maintain the angle of the earphones to ensure the quality of sound even during intense workouts.And yes, they can be used for swimming.  It's too cold now, but I did use them in the shower.My second favorite feature, after the amazing sound quality, was the control pod on the left ear extension.  On my iPod, I can control the volume and pause\/play without taking it out of my pocket.  The control pod also works with the iPhone to answer and hang up calls.  It even worked on my Droid phone.Bottom line, these earphones are a portable and practical way to get way more music from your portable music devices.  If you love music and paid hundreds of dollars for your collection, why not enjoy the entire range of sound?Other observations:Monster mentions that there is a break in period, roughly 20 hours of use, before these will perform at their best.The fitted headphones do such a good job of blocking out outside noise that they could be a problem when you are driving, especially if an emergency vehicle is approaching."}

Setup is pretty standard with most Logitech remotes so I won't go into details there as once you learn their straight forward tool it is easy to make changes.  For those who don't know, Logitech can control nearly every device out there that uses IR.I bought this remote primarily for the iOS interface but I have found the included plain remote to be equally as nice and sleek to keep out if I don't want to use my phone.  The system controls all my devices reliably even though I have multiple shelves and only used 1 IR blaster.My only complaint is with the changes that Logitech has made around the Help command.  It is not as easy to use on the iOS app and the physical remote does not have this.  This could be better documented or communicated for those who are familiar with Harmony remotes or for those who are new and don't know what to do when things don't work quite the way it should.I have bought Logitech remotes for my mom to save my sanity on having to help troubleshoot her system.

It also has the DIGIC 4 chip (that's something important, one smart brain in this box). It has a 28mm wide angle as does the A4000. It has only a 5X optical, 5X digital zoom. The &#34;IS&#34; stands for Intelligent systems, and while BOTH cameras take awesome pictures and represent for normal folks super deals that will keep up with the far more expensive cameras (like those listed above) for normal use, the A4000 IS deals with tricky lighting and the outer margins of early morning, late evening, backlit scenes, and so on, better than the A2500. BOTH are super deals. My tired eyes appreciate that larger display on the somewhat more expensive A4000 IS. I also like to &#34;crop tight&#34; meaning I really zoom in.

Find and download version 1.2.2 and when it asks to upgrade just hit cancel. Made it through several full length movies with no issues at all.I apologize for no original pics but my current camera blows hard unless actually using the light on the surface of the sun.First the basics.[...]The Skytex Skypad Alph[\/url]a comes in your standard MID type box. You can tell the revision of your pad, A or B, by the image on the top of the box. If you have the green cloudy field you have an A, if your have the amber sunset field it is a B.The Skypad comes with a soft cloth case, felt screen swipe, earphones with their own volume control., USB cable, stand for horizontal or vertical use, charger, and in my opinion the greatest pad accessory in the world, a stylus with a screw on cap that plugs into the headphone jack of your pad. Why don't all pads?The style of the Skypad is sleek and simple. I mentioned previously it feels kind of strange but pleasant in your hand when compared to other pads. Like an e-reader on steroids. It's slender with a nice solid feel, on the ends it has a brushed metallic trim, the back has a black coating that has a nice no slip feel to it. You have the Menu, Home, and Back button on the right front side of the face and the Skytex logo on the bottom. The bottom right side has you Mini USB and power adapter ports, the top right side has the headphone jack and power button. On the back you have your speaker and the reset pinhole.The specs are as follows: ScreenType: 7\" (diagonal) color LCD DisplayResolution: 800x480 SVGATouch type: ResistiveCPU  Freescale i.MX515 ARM Cortex-A8 (800Mhz core + 200Mhz DSP)Memory 512MB RAMStorage 4GB Internal External microSD Card support (up to 32GB)Supported Formats Audio MP3, WAV, WMA, OGG, AAC, M4A, FLACVideo (720p playback) H.264, MKV, WMV, MOV, 3GP, MPE, AVIImage JPG, GIF, BMP, PNGLanguages English, Spanish, Chinese Traditional & Simplified, German, French, Russian, Polish, Korean, JapaneseWireless  Wi-Fi 802.11b\/g\/nBluetooth 2.0Ins and Outsmini-USB 2.0 portmicro SD card slot3.5mm Earphone Jack1.3MP front-facing cameraPower Volltage: 100~240VAC, 50\/60HzBattery: 3000mAh Rechargeable Li-PolymerPowering Up.I was pretty impressed with the 22 second boot from button to slide lock. Once inside it is a refreshing minimalist install. You have all the basics Aldiko e-reader, Astro Filemanager, Getjar market,movie and photo players, Dev tools which I think are a version of Spare Parts, e-mail, calendar, etc... Not a ton of bloatware or craptastic uselessness. You will need to install Gapps\/market and Flash yourself. I installed the latest with no issues. Youtube and web streaming works great.Resistive ScreenThe display is bright and crisp. The resistive touch is not an issue on this pad. Very sentsitive, you can just use the tip of your finger or fingernail. That said the fine touch using the stylus and the screen responsiveness make using a stylus nice and easy. I tend not to like using stylus but I find my self more and more using it on the Skypad. It's nice to have a choice I guess where some resistive touch screen leave you no option. I honestly can't see the extra cost of a capacitive screen on another brand being worth it.The spec sheet says 720P on Video but I tossed a couple of 1080P BR rips and they played perfect. Nothing I have played on it has had any issue other than some voice sync, which occurs on some player but not other so It is not the machine's issue.In an age where our attention spans are lessening and we think in terms of seconds, the power of the pad is great. Most apps and games install as fast as you can click them. I have tried most of the standards Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja with no issue. The G-sensor works great with the couple of games I have tried it on Wave Runner was a blast.WifiI activated and installed my wifi in just a few seconds. Much like a lot of pads the signal strength is a little low. No disconnects, but the occasional low signal where there should be no issue. I installed Wifi fixer and that helped a little. This is to be expected in a first release firmware really.BluetoothAdded my BT headphone no problem. When trying streaming some video bogged down. Not sure if that is a BT or Skypad issue. I am going to re-flash the stock image then try that first and see. Could be related to something I have changed or installed.USB to ComputerWorks great. Make sure you have a USB 2.0 compliant controller and it is plenty fast. Try the hard mounted USB on the back of your PC. Installs the internal and external memory as two separate drives.SoundThis is the first pad I have had that the sound is more than adequate from the internal speakers in a normal home or office environment. Even out on our porch it wasn't too bad, The sound volume is software controlled so nice idea but is a little issue when using the speaker. The headphones come with a volume wheel. Perhaps someone could come up with a always on top type widget so you can get to the volume while in a movie or game.BatteryI still have to run a live to dead battery test but I did get through two episode of True Blood and Gone in 60 Seconds last night with battery to spare. I have gone almost 5 hours with wifi on now. Pretty nice compared to some other pads even with the same battery.SupportGreat. US Company located in Cali. My first call I got straight through. No waiting no translating Engrish or Engladesh. Sorry if anyone is offended but that is a reality of Ce tech support. I wasn;t talked down to we took just a couple minutes to figure out the issue. It is noce to know the company is following the mod community with trying to influence it or control it. >>>>>coughapadcough&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; sorry something caught in my throat.Firmware Upgrade\/FlashTo some unfamiliar with flashing the process may seem a little complicated but really it is very simple. Connect, Find, Flash.I had an issue with a setting defaulting that shouldn't once we figured that out I just reinstalled the software and it was fine.So my overall impression?Pros:DesignEase of UsePowerStable firmware releaseApp and Game compatibilityResponsive clean resistive touchDid I mention a cool self storing stylus? ( I don't know why that impresses me so much. I once paid $3000 over book on a convertible just because I fell in love with the power top was controlled by a joystick type toggle instead of a simple switch)Cons:It is hard to really have any cons that aren't more on personal preference than actual functionality. The power button feels a little soft, but is is also a nice flush design. HDMI out would be nice, but not necessary. Wifi could be stronger but really what pad has it on first release. Until any Ce is out in the wild and hitting all the variables there are, it can;t work perfect with every other component out there. They all need a little tweak time.I would rate is as 5\/5 . Any issues I have really are just preference over function. For the price It is was a great deal. This blows the doors off my Flytouch 3 10 inch.EDIT UPDATE: An unofficial \"official\" support forum has popped up on  Slatedroid dot com"}

Most microfiber clothes look more like terry cloth to me and those long fibers collect grime and grit which can easily scratch delicate touch screens on smart phones, lap tops, computers and other high end electronics.Cloth addiction has virtually no pile whatsoever - it feels like a very thin cut of suede, very smooth and quite unique.Benefits:1) Cloth Addiction can clean chemical free - no need to spray on cleaners.2) Degradable \"Green\" Product.3) Includes two clothes one giant 8.85\" X 12\" Plus one 7\" X 7\"4) Makes Finger prints and smudges vanishSo far I've used the smaller cloth on my a new Laptop which is in Piano Black and a finger print magnet - the cloth made both the screen and case pristine in seconds.Great for large screen televisions, your cell phone, home phone even eye glasses and readers.Of course there are some applications where you'll need a cleaning solution and I would suggest using another cloth.There are clothes that are cheaper but considering the investment in the electronics that have become so essential to our daily lives why skimp?It's money well spent.One more thing - the packaging is very small. Mine arrived in a huge box because I had a large order with about eight items in it.I tossed the box and while going over the invoice realized I didn't have the Cloth Addiction 2 Pack. After checking my account to make sure it was shipped - I found it under one of the cardboard folds at the bottom of the box (I know Idiot) But hey, these things happen."}

Philips have a good reputation for high quality video and audio equipment at a reasonable price. This webcam is certainly in that category. Compared to my less expensive Logitech webcam, the picture quality is certainly improved. The auto focus feature and the wider angle are all plusses for those family gatherings across the Atlantic  by video. Last Christmas we actually played a game of charades via webcam - but we had to slow down the motions because of blurring. This little puppy performs much better - so Christmas Charades 2010 here we come!! The price weems competitive and the construction is solid. Recommended. One slight drawback....if you're not using a notebook but rather a PC the USB cord is a little short!"}

The remote is about $160 and I was not going to spend that kind of money for a remote that could potentially be chewed again.  I read quite a few of the reviews on this unit and decided to take a chance as I thought it would at least be functional if not quite the one button convenience of watching TV, DVD, etc... afforded by the Harmony remote.  It's a little more difficult to set up than the Harmony one but I am pleasantly surprised by the end result.  I use it to control my Xbox 360 (which we actually use more for Netflix\/Hulu Plus\/Amazon on demand) to watch TV as we cut our cable bill.  It controls the TV we watch some over the air broadcasts on the network channels via a simple antenna, Surround sound receiver, DVD player, and VCR (rarely used these days)  Using the programmable macro function, I have set up each of the component buttons to turn on all devices and swap to the correct inputs with the touch of one button.For example I press my TV button, turns on TV sets input to GAME input, turns on receiver sets input to DTV\/Cable, turns on Xbox and everything is set to go, the middle arrow buttons on the remote perfectly control the menus in xbox 360 so clicking and scrolling through the games\/apps is perfect...even more convenient than the xbox controller.Likewise I press the DVD button...everything turns on and the DVD player is set to go with full control on the remote.One tip, when programming a macro for one button control....insert a pause at the beginning.  This allows you to manually switch between your components in the remote if you simply want to, but the macro will only activate if you hold the button for two seconds.It really replaces my harmony one remote completely...if you have a little patience you can set it up to have one button control your viewing activities.There were a couple of buttons on my receiver, that this remote was able to 'learn'For less than $25 this remote is an absolute steal.  It is incredibly powerful, a little difficult to program if you want everything perfect, but well worth the effort."}

{"reviewerID":"A2T6MYD9VVPMEU","reviewText":"I do alot of extensive video editing and use my Logitech headset to narrate over the clips.  One grievance I had about my headset was the fact that despite its \"clear chat\" label it was devoid of a windscreen mouth piece or anything on the device to cancel out popping p's.  I found this little doohickey and had a feeling it would more or less take care of this problem. Sure enough it slipped on my bulky Logitech mouth piece just fine and is not the least bit lose.The only real way to find out if it could really perform the desired task though was to put it to the test.  I moved the mouth piece much closer to my face than I normally do and uttered a classic tongue twister filled to the brim with popping p's: \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\"  No matter how much emphasis I put on on each p it would still sound pristinely perfect.  To make things trickier, I put my ceiling fan on high and moved the headset right underneath to see if it would catch any wind noise.  It was not until I was a foot away from the blades (which I do not recommend by the way) that I started to notice any audio distortion.So if you are looking for a simple foam windscreen to slip on your headset\/microphone, this one will do the job just fine!"}

It seems to scratch relatively easily, however - I noticed a couple tiny scratches in the finish upon opening the box.  It's designed to remain standing upright on a surface (as shown in the product image), and probably wouldn't be a good hard drive choice if you're looking for portability.Capacity:My computer recognizes this drive as a 2.72 TB drive, which is well within the typical range for rated-vs-actual capacities of hard drives.Compatibility:While this is specifically called a Mac drive, it can be easily reformatted to be used on any other computer type.  In windows 7, you can do this by plugging in the drive, opening the Computer Management utility (found in the System Tools section of Control Panel), deleting the MAC partition, then formatting it as an NTFS drive.  I did this as soon as I got the drive, and it has worked great.Speed:The drive uses USB 3.0 (for fastest transfers), but it is also backwards-compatible with USB 2.0 if that's all your computer supports.  I'm not sure what the RPM rating of the drive is, it doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.Noise:I can't even hear it over the sound of my laptop fan, even when transferring data. I would say the noise is slightly less than the average 3.5\" external HDD.Reliability:No reliability issues after the first couple days of use, but only time will tell how reliable any hard drive is.  I'll post an update to this review if the drive ever experiences any issues."}

He said its a must have lens replacing your whole bag almost. And \"sharp at every aperture\". Well, I did get a sharp one after 3 tries ! 2 out of three other copies were very soft on 1\/4 of the outer parts of the frame at 28 mm. This did get better as aperture went toward f6.3 - f8 but really !!!!! ,, really !!!  I did also read other post on the net saying they had similar experiences having to try multiple lenses before getting a perfect one . Which I now have.... YAAAAYYYSo finally I did get a good copy and am VERY happy with it. Very, Very sharp, at pretty much all apertures and MM's but of course there is a tiniest softness when shooting 28mm and wide open however with my copy this can only be seen on my 16 mp camera blown up to more than 50%. All in all I am pleased to finally get what I expected in the first place.Personally I would make sure you buy from reputable companies that have a good exchange policy like amazon. There customer service is perhaps one of the best I have ever encountered but ultimately I don't trust Nikons quality control anymore.I would give a five star rating for this lens, however I will take into account that it took me 3 copies to get a great one, for this reason I will score THIS lens a 5 star . If I could also score the other lenses I tried first before getting this copy, I would give those a mere 3."}

{"reviewerID":"A2P6GX8V66XLAD","reviewText":"I researched a wide range of 52\" LCD's and came to the conclusion that the LN52A650 fit my needs the best.  It also helped that it was CR's top rated 52\" LCD.  Picture quality is exceptional, and the auto motion plus anti-juddering really gives the image a three-dimensional quality.  It doesn't look unnatural to me at all, but rather, immerses one in the scene.  The touch of red feature is just red plastic - its not backlit.  It is unobtrusive and you only notice the red if sunlight is shining on it.  As for glare, the picture is so bright that I do not see glare as an issue even with the afternoon sunshine right on the screen.Negatives?  I wish the remote had preset buttons for picture control - for example, I like to use different settings for watching movies vs watching broadcast cable HD channels.  Also the remote's scroll wheel tries to mimic an ipod, but is far less responsive.  This doesn't detract from the outstanding performance of the television though, and I would recommend it to everyone.I actually compared the LN52A650 to the Sony 52\" XBR6 at the local BB and the pictures were essentially identical.  The XBR supposedly has better speakers but I don't know any home theater enthusiast who doesn't feed sound through a surround system, so the television's speakers don't get used anyways."}

I really wish I had purchased it before. The 1.2 magnification doesn't seem that amazing, but suddenly my ability to tell what's in focus and what's out of focus is improved by a lot more than 20%. It feels like double, in fact.The only caveat is: it's no good if you shoot wearing glasses. I normally wear contacts, and with my eye right to the viewfinder, the vignetting is insignificant. I have to be a bit more careful about where exactly I put my eye, but it's easy to get the hang of it. However, when I tried with my glasses on, I discovered that reduced eyepoint makes the edges of the frame significantly obscured, to the point where the status line is invisible.So the bottom line is: if you don't wear glasses, this is a must-buy. If you do, consider getting contact lenses. :)I'm giving four stars instead of five because the eyepoint issue is a legitimate complaint, and because it'd be nice if they could magically make it do an even larger magnification (without making the vignetting even worse)."}

Now that I've used it for a couple of months, I'm happy to learn that I'm right :-).  I love it, even with the one glitch that other reviewers warned about.I bought this case for my brand-new iPod touch.  I'd questioned whether a case was really necessary, but after reading lots of other people's experiences, it seemed prudent to get one.  Sure enough, the little sucker has already slipped out of my hands a few times, and I'm very glad it was there.  It was very easy to put on, and it feels great in your hands.  It has the right amount of non-slip grip without adding too much bulk overall.Some folks didn't like the two tabs on the bottom, where the various connectors plug into the iPod touch.  While they do tend to protrude and dangle a little, that really doesn't bother me.  Unlike others, I haven't cut them off - when in your pocket, it's good to have those connectors covered, even imperfectly.Now, for the one glitch.  The sides of the case do indeed sometimes push against the clear screen protector, and pull it up away from the screen a bit.  It's really not a big deal; I just nudge it, and that part of the protector snaps back into place.I would definitely recommend getting this case.  In retrospect, the only change I would have made is to get it in a color other than black.  Although it fits in well with the device overall, I think having a vibrant color or two would be even nicer than an all-black experience."}

{"reviewerID":"A8L0ECCW5JUGY","reviewText":"Despite having read the negative reviews on this case, I decided to give it a try.I have only been using the case for about 24 hours now, but it is exactly what I was looking for. The appearance is nothing fancy. It's a simple flat color (in my case, black) that has a little bit of a sporty look to it. No bells and whistles.The case is very lightweight, which is great, being that the Kindle itself is so heavy. The back side of the case provides a sturdy frame for the body of the Kindle to rest in, while the front side is a flap that folds over to protect the screen. The flap itself looks similar to the Ipad 2 smart cover, without being magnetized. It has a heavy crease down the middle, which folds in and tucks into a ridge that is built into the back of the case. It appears that this wouldn't function very well as a sturdy stand, but with the weight of the Kindle, it works great. So far I have tried it on both a desk, and on my lap. I trust that with more use, it will fit better and feel a little more sturdy.Also, you shouldn't expect this case to provide much protection in the trauma department. I don't trust that it would completely protect the Kindle if it were dropped. It will, however, protect it from scrapes and scuffs from normal use.Overall, I am very satisfied with the case. If you are looking for a lightweight case with a slim profile that provides cosmetic protection for your Kindle, this is perfect."}

I've been using the keyboard for about two weeks and among the three bars giving the battery status, I've gone from 2 to 1.The battery door seems to screw in to the underside of the machine.  While that's an inconvenience (I was expecting a plastic slide door), I expect the set up will prove far more durable.  And I'll take durability over convenience almost always.Not the prettiest keyboard, and not much fancy about it, but it's a workhorse.

Its space saving, comes with 2 standard 120mm fans, and the best part is that its a closed loop which means theres no maintenance on the liquid solution inside of it. Came with some preapplied compound but can be taken off easily to apply aftermarket thermal paste. You can easily overclock to 4.4-4.7ghz and keep up with the heat it puts out."}
{"reviewerID":"A3FPTGF6TRQGA6","reviewText":"I have had this camera for almost a year. It performs very well, takes great pictures, and was a great price. Recently, I had some trouble with the lens extending. Make sure that you do not accidentally press the on button while the camera lense is unable to extend (like while it is in a case that does not allow the lense to extend). It was covered by warranty and Canon fixed it very quickly, with no charge. I am very impressed with this camera and Canon's warranty service. You can't go wrong with this camera! Watch the higher prices charged from some sellers on Amazon; chcek out all the sellers and you'll see that this camera sells for about $170--$180."}

{"reviewerID":"A2JW4AOWXS1CN9","reviewText":"9 out of 10 people wouldn't realize this is an aftermarket battery. The fit was really good on mine. It isn't perfect, but close enough.I have fully depleted it and recharged several times in order to calibrate the batter, and it seems to be accurate to the meter in the menu bar.I got about 1.5 hrs out of it streaming video over youtube. A little less than I was hoping, but I don't typically stream much video on the laptop.It's nice being able to actually hold the computer on your lap. The original battery would get too hot, and it had expanded\/warped, which I believe is a potential safety hazard.I must also point out that the customer service from Anker has been terrific. They sent an inquiry email shortly after receiving the battery, asking for initial feedback. I sent them my over-all impressions of the battery, and they shortly replied to that also. They have made it very clear that this battery is backed by an 18 month warranty. It's nice to find a company that stands behind their product."}

The picture quality depends on your internet connection; mine is 2.5 Mb\/s DSL, so HD is not possible but standard def rarely has glitches.My big issue with it is not being able to stream from a PC (especially music).  The hardware would support it but it might cut into their other product's sales.  For not much more $ now, you can get a blu-ray player which has both Netflix and pandora music streaming.  I may end up using the Roku with a second TV instead.Revision (2009.12.7):  Roku just added Pandora and other \"channels\", which is exactly what was lacking.  I'm glad to see they are willing and able to enhance the product."}
{"reviewerID":"A18EJ44LWWUO11","reviewText":"This is a great Bluetooth speaker that is compact, sleek looking (zeppelin look), and has decent sound.The speaker comes a USB charging cable (microUSB, which is nice since this is becoming a standard), an Aux cable, a quick start guide, and the speaker itself. The box is small and simple, with no frills. It's useful to save for transport of the speaker, especially since it's very small.I found I needed the guide to understand the controls on the speaker. They weren't entirely intuitive, and I wish they had included separate volume controls, rather than grouping it with the forward and back buttons. However, it was only a minor issue, as I usually control volume using device that's playing the music.The sound is really impressive for a speaker this size. I only found very minor distortion at the highest volumes, and it's worth noting that it gets very very loud. Bass was impressive, and sound quality was clear.The Bluetooth range is good with device. In my tests, I got to 20 feet before it cut out. One interesting thing with this speaker is that the indicator light is below the controls, so it's kind of difficult to see.I really liked that the battery was user replaceable, and in my tests, I got 5-6 hours of usage time. Very impressive for a speaker at this price point. Recharging only took 1-2 hours!Overall, I really like this Bluetooth speaker, and I recommend it. You can't go wrong for the price EasyAcc sells it at.I was provided with this item free of charge in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation. If you have any questions, feel free to comment below or contact me in my profile."}

{"reviewerID":"A29SUCM2FD90R9","reviewText":"I don't even know where to start. Considering this headset cost $4, I didn't have my hopes up, but after seeing some reviews, I decided to give it a try. My old headset started to give out so I needed a new one. First time I used it, I heard a constant noise from the right speaker, which leads me to believe there's something wrong with the speaker. It's not any noise you can simply ignore either. It gets really annoying. As for the mic quality...I'll quote my friends words on Skype. \"Oh god, get your other headset.\"Update: Surprisingly, for some reason, once I removed the foam filter on the mic, it worked fine. I used it until it died on me shortly after, but then again, I go through a lot of headsets and for $4, this lasted as long as I expected it under the conditions I put it through. Shortly after this one, I bought another one but this second one really was horrible. Even with removing the foam filter, it still sounded really bad, so my feelings about this headset are somewhat mixed."}

{"reviewerID":"AWH2AY17ZU7W2","reviewText":"What I really love about this headset is the complete attention to detail. They provide every cable imaginable so you're set to go out of the box if you're using it for a PC, phone, game, or audio system. They give you TWO batteries, and the spare is always charged on the transmitter... never again will your headset say &#34;game over&#34;. The boom mic tucks discretely into the headphone so when your not using it communicate it doesn't get in the way. There's no annoying remote to get lost, all the controls are built into the headphone. When plugged into a PC it was all plug and play with no power required (although I'm sure the battery charging will benefit from being plugged in).And since it has it's own transmitter, there's no need to constantly pair them with your device, just move the transmitter. Also the range is far superior to Bluetooth. Of course the tradeoff is portability since the transmitter needs to be plugged in... it makes it a little less useful for mp3 players and phones, but it's much better for set-top audio devices and devices that only have a headphone\/audio jack.The only think I would have like to seen changed would be labels on the headset buttons and controls. They're labeled with removable stickers out of the box and are easy to learn, remember and\/or figure out, but someone just picking them up will have to figure out how to turn them on. On one hand it makes them look a lot sleeker, but in this case I'd prefer a little bit more function over form.Altogether, these look, sound and feel great. I'd highly recommend them if you're in the market for top of the line gaming or communication headsets which can double duty has superb headphones."}

It does not take video, but if you want really good video you'll need a camcorder anyway. Most DSLR's are only okay at video.

As you can imagine, a quality WEB cam is high on my list of important things. So, I was excited to get the chance to try out this Logitech C920-C.I have been very impressed with this camera. First, I was delighted by how easy it was to install it . . .just plugged the USB cable in, and the drivers installed themselves. I turned Skype on, and Skype instantly found and opened the camera. No work at all to get it on and operating.I have been very pleased with the quality of the video from the camera. It produces a crystal clear, noise free image. This has been by far the best WEB cam I have owned.I also like the feature that it has a lens cover you can slide over the lens ensuring your privacy when the camera is not in use.There is one feature that is bothersome about this camera. The effective focus range is from a few inches to about 10 feet. It will not focus clearly at infinity. In fact, the focus is quiet poor at infinity. This is a problem with all the Logitech cameras in this series. There are several tutorials on the WEB of how to take the cameras apart and manually adjust them so that they can focus at infinity, but  I was never able to get the adjustment done where pictures are sharp beyond about 10 feet.I give the camera five stars because most people will use it for video conferencing, where it will focus at the relevant distances for that application. However, be aware if you intend to use it on subjects more than about 10 feet away, the focus is poor."}

{"reviewerID":"A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","reviewText":"This camera is a wonderful option--the best in my opinion--for certain types of photographers. One type would be a pro or advanced enthusiast who wants or needs the features and controls of a top DSLR but who sometimes doesn't want to carry the weight or wants a backup or is traveling and wants to be confident of handling every challenge; the other target is someone who wants to learn to use those comprehensive features and controls with an easy-to-carry package. It could be argued that this defines a new category of camera: \"micro DSLR,\" with certain threshold requirements, including pocketable size, lots of buttons and dials, RAW shooting, a viewfinder, a flash hot shoe and associated controls, and near professional image quality. That's where the P7800 fits right in. On the other hand, if what you want is a small, shirt pocket camera that's a step up from your smartphone and you primarily use the little green Auto function; if you are willing to trade size, weight, and cost to get a bigger sensor; or if you want a smaller camera with a bigger sensor and proprietary hot shoe and can live without an electronic viewfinder and zoom range (think Sony RX100ii), there are better choices, including the Coolpix P330. You must also accept that the compactness and comprehensive features will raise the price and you have to relent somewhat on image quality. I thought I would share some of the reasons I think the P7800 fills the bill and is worth its price, while laying out some features that might not be apparent and dispelling some misunderstandings. This camera has a lot of functionality, so bear with me.First, The P7800 is indeed a pocket camera in the sense that it will fit in some pockets, like cargo pockets. Having it in a sport coat breast pocket makes you feel like a goodfella. But it is nicely inconspicuous and has a very good grip. Its 1\/1.7\" back-illuminated CMOS sensor is small compared to DSLRs', but it's much larger than point-and-shoots'. It does a fine job up to 8x10 prints from JPEG; for the web, it's ideal. I shoot RAW+JPEG. The 12-bit-depth RAW files are 4000x3000 dpi and are 27 MB while the highest quality JPEGs (which are 8-bit) have 4:1 compression and are 5 MB. Compare that to an NEF file from a DX-size DSLR measuring 3892x2605 and 11 MB (because they're compressed), with best JPEG at 7.3 MB. The P7800 has a modern, state-of-the-art image processor and sensor, so it is no surprise that its JPEGs compare favorably to images from not much older cameras with much larger sensors. And its RAW (NRW) files have the potential to be outstanding, except perhaps in terms of low-light noise. All this is helped by the P7800 image ratio of 4:3, which is closer to 8x10 than the 3:2 ratio of most DLSRs and so uses more of the pixels to make a conventional print.You can trim the saturation, sharpening, contrast, and white balance of several available picture control settings, comparing them with a graphical presentation if you like. If this review piques your interest, you can find plenty of sample pictures online to download and examine, and plenty of technical tests at DxOMark and elsewhere to compare. The P7800's 1080HD videos, too, look great, and there are more user video controls than you might expect, including a low-noise zoom for those who zoom while filming. Since the P7800 has a mic input jack with level adjustment, unlike the Canon G16, it actually makes sense to consider it for serious video, including use with a wireless mic (there's an AC adapter available if battery life is a concern). A half-hour video in AVC\/H.264 consumes about 4 GB.I compared the Nikon Coolpix P7800 extensively to the Canon PowerShot G16. They have the same size sensors and, though some experts have slightly preferred the P7800's image quality, for me there's not enough difference there to force a decision. Where the Nikon really outscores the Canon is in handling and accessibility of controls. The Nikon's EVF offers full info display and walks all over the G16's limited optical view finder, while the P7800's LCD is fully articulated, not fixed like the G16's--you can even turn it face forward for group selfies, macro setups, or to narrate an instructional video. Neither have touch screens. To let you know the camera is on when the LCD is closed, the ON button lights up (the exposure compensation dial also has an index that lights when it is in use). You might not want to judge color through the EVF, but it is 100% frame accurate and the info display, including live histogram, is very readable so there is no need to refer to the LCD while shooting.The P7800 has the kind of controls you would expect of a pro DSLR, or better; often they are customizable in useful ways. White Balance, for example, offers two Auto modes, seven presets, a mode that lets you directly dial in Kelvins with live display, and a manual (grey card) mode saved to three additional custom presets; this is handy when you encounter weird lighting, such as \"white\" LED light banks or CFL. Each mode has a fine trim adjustment using a Yellow-Blue vs Green-Magenta graph.There are three custom setups available on the mode dial, in addition to Nikon's My Menu function; when you are using one, its settings appear in its own menu. There are many more places to customize functions and image processing, with graphs and helpful explanations. Amazingly (in the past I have groaned at Nikon firmware) these functions are really easy to access and make use of.The camera has two thumbwheels (in addition to the main rotary selector dial) that normally control the f-stop (2 to 8) and shutter speed (1\/4000 to 60 sec). You can assign them many custom functions when combined with the Fn1 button. When used this way, the display shows icons that remind you how you set them up. I often change metering mode between Matrix, Center Weighted, and Spot, as these control functions in the SB-700 flash, so though metering is a single button press to get to it in My Menu, setting it as an option for Fn2 makes it super easy. The G16 has only one such dial; to control shutter speed you sometimes but not always use its rotary selection dial. The Fn2 button next to the P7800's shutter release can be assigned to turn off info in the display, turn on virtual horizons in the display, hide the histogram, hide the framing grid, or turn on the 3-stop ND filter--with one press. The G16 has no Fn buttons.The ISO can be set from 80 to 3200, plus Hi1 (6400). In addition to full Auto, you can limit the upper Auto value to 200, 400, or 800. That's very thoughty.The P7800 offers three ways to deal with high dynamic range subjects. It offers D-Lighting which can be applied to already shot JPEGs or Active D-Lighting which can be turned on for JPEGs as they are shot, both in three strengths (in my experience: not enough, about right, and too much). Some shooters leave ADL always on at low strength. There is also a \"Backlighting\" scene mode which you can jump to with a twist of the mode control knob to SCENE. This mode invokes multi-shot HDR, in three strengths, as you shoot JPEGs. If you want to do HDR yourself in post, you can select 3-shot or 5-shot bracketing at .3 or 1 stop steps (these also work in RAW). You can bracket using shutter speed, f-stop, ISO, or white balance.Let me address a few issues that some have turned up their noses at. First, the button to turn on the EVF. I've never used it, because the EVF turns on automatically when you fold the LCD display towards the camera body, which is how I use it. If you open the LCD to check images, the EVF turns off automatically. Next, lack of WiFi. This isn't a big issue if you have a tablet or laptop nearby because swapping SD cards is very fast. The only function of the Canon G16 WiFi is to transfer selected already-shot JPEGs to another WiFi node, such as your smartphone, from which you can then transfer them elsewhere. If you need that functionality, your options include the WiFi adapter, WiFi card reader, or an EyeFi SD card, which allows transfers to specific web sites, setting permissions, and other functions. The P7800 has a menu option for EyeFi cards (but you still need a WiFi hot spot). NFC per the Sony RX100 is what you really want for wireless transfer. Requiring a GPS add-on is an asset, because that gives me a remote control port. You can plug in a YN RF-603N with YN-N3 cable and get a cheap, radio, two-step remote shutter release with multiple flash control, or if you need sophisticated intervalometers, there are plenty of inexpensive options that plug right in. And finally, comments on slowness: I typically shoot RAW+JPEG at full resolution and, though I do use a very fast, Class 10 SD card (why not?) I don't find myself waiting on the camera. It is certainly faster than flash recharge. Choosing the option to view a shot for a couple of seconds after it is taken also slows things down, but that can be turned off. If you do rapid continuous (as opposed to burst) shooting, which I don't do or know anyone who does with a compact camera, you should do some hands-on tests, as \"fast\" can be subjective. True, if you shoot a six-frame burst in RAW+JPEG, the P7800 locks up for 15 seconds while it process the burst. The Canon also slows way down shooting RAW, and for me it drifted in and out of focus if Autofocus was enabled in continuous shooting, so there's no perfect solution. The P7800 autofocus, by the way, is faster than most, but it could be faster--but what camera's couldn't?Of course the Canon G16 has many of these functions as well. What makes the Nikon far preferable for me is that the P7800's functions are more likely to be readily accessible on a physical knob or Fn button rather than somewhere in a menu that can be hard to see in bright daylight (I sometimes shoot ski mountaineering). I'd say the controls are more usable than most DSLR's and the overall ergonomics are excellent. The EVF is something I couldn't live without, and the G16's optical VF pales in comparison and is a real pain if there's something in the hot shoe. Same with the extra zoom range; I often shoot portraits or body shots at over 100 mm, so I appreciate the 7.1x zoom, a bit more than the G16's 5x. The Canon has focus peaking to aid manual focus, which works well on high-contrast areas; the Nikon manual focus aid uses a zoomed-in area in the center of the live frame and allows you to start with Autofocus there and then trim it; for me, that works better and gives me more control, particularly when shooting macros. I find I use the pano assist function more than I would have thought, because it works really well and is easy to use; the Canon doesn't have pano functions. Both cameras have various special effects and post processing functions that might be amusing; Background Defocus works nicely, but I have yet to try Pet Portrait. Mostly I don't use them. Image quality might be a tie, but the Nikon has enough hands-on advantages that it was ultimately not a hard decision.Anything I don't like? Not much. I'd like to see an option for AdobeRGB color space for JPEGs, but since I mostly shoot RAW, that's not a bother (RAW can be processed in the camera, if needed). At the moment, in my Linux environment, NRW thumbnails show up as TIFF files (which is basically what a RAW file is, with additional metadata); annoying to have to use the same-named JPEG for reference (which is not Nikon's fault), but the files themselves open just fine in various Free-and-Open-Source applications that are available for Linux, such as showFoto and UFRaw, but RawTherapee wants a profile. [I would strongly urge serious photographers to investigate Linux photo applications, including the GIMP, which I have come to prefer to Photoshop\/Lightroom. You'll save enough to buy a P7800!] Photoshop CS5 wouldn't open NRW files at all, but the camera comes with ViewNX2 (Windows, Mac, Linux in WINE) which will do  basic conversions to TIFF or JPEG, or try Picassa or Google+, or you can buy Bibble or Capture One (search \"raw image file format\" on Wikipedia for the latest). The 40.5 mm filter size is a pain.And the P7800 doesn't work perfectly with the affordable Youngnuo flashes, like the YN565 and YN468ii (which is their fault); for example, the YN468ii  in TTL mode tracks the camera's focal length and f-stop, but the flash power is all or nothing, so it becomes a manual flash that tracks f-stop and zoom. Commander mode in the camera doesn't get a response, at least for me, but S1 and S2 are fine because they don't depend on the camera at all. The camera doesn't recognize some flash remotes, like the Youngnuo RF-603N, until you set its Flash Control from Auto to External Flash; then all is fine. The Nikon SB700 works perfectly, of course, except for no AF assist light; it reports that the P7800 works in CLS and AWL, and it responds in Commander mode if it is set to Group A and Channel 3... but it costs 2\/3 of what the camera does and it's physically larger. Because of the way the P7800 \"shutter\" works, flash sync is maintained at all shutter speeds, all the way up to 1\/4000--without having to use high speed sync (which Nikon calls Auto FP High Speed Sync on their cheap $6000 DSLRs). This is even better than HSS, because it causes no surprises by changing with shutter speed and it can be used to trigger slave flashes, which HSS can't. High speed shutter sync is essential when you're trying to balance fill flash with wide f-stop in bright conditions. Speaking of flash, the Gary Fong 4\/3 Puffer works just fine on the built-in flash.All in all, I love this camera and I'm more and more reserving the tonnage of my DSLR kit for when it's absolutely needed. Now I shoot Hasselblad or Sinar film when it's demanded, and have fun with the P7800 when I'm shooting for fun, family, or the web, knowing it has the tools for every situation. Horses for courses. It's said that the best camera in the world is the one you actually brought along, and the P7800 makes its choice inviting. Like everybody who gives 5* reviews, I'll end by saying that I made a brilliant purchase decision, and you should too.LINUX addendum: If you're interested in using Free-and-Open-Source software, there are plenty of high quality options available. I checked which ones open NRW files produced by the P7800. These include LightZone, Fotoxx, Darktable, and digiKam. Most are 16-bit, preserving the 12-bit RAW from the camera. They can output 16-bit PNG or TIF files which can be further edited in GIMP, which now handles 8-, 16-, and 32-bit fixed or floating point precision, including importing 16-bit PSD files. The first programs are comparable to Lightroom and the GIMP compares favorable to Photoshop, though its learning curve is just as daunting. I run mostly on Ubuntu Linux, which will be immediately familiar to Mac users, so I don't know how the Windows and OSX versions perform. I use Windows only when some unusual requirement forces me to use Photoshop. There are FOS programs for HDR work, too, including Luminance HDR and Fotoxx after v14. There are HDR plugins for the GIMP using exposure blend and there's a cool tone mapping add-on. All free."}

The device will hold 3.5 inch drives and 2.5 inch drives.  There is no cooling but if you power have the OS spin down unused drives they won't get very warm, and if you go for the WD Red series you'll never have a heat problem anyway.  Mechanically a flat hard drive is more stable than one sitting vertically.  I have had issues with vertical drives getting bumped and making only partial connection to the SATA interface.Why 4 stars - nothing USB should ever get more than 4 stars.  It's a crappy interface, made sloppy by the trashy vendors who don't understand the specification and their frequently counterfeit designs.

{"reviewerID":"A31WE0G828ZWY5","reviewText":"I bought this 256 MB memory stick because I wanted the flexibility of traveling for more than a few days at a time with my Sony (DSC P-9) camera without bringing along my laptop or any of the cumbersome devices for downloading photos. I figured that where my 128 MB memory stick proved too limited, combining its capacity with this new 256 MB stick would be just what I needed.In the end, I was only partially right.I don't have a problem with having to flick a tiny switch to have access to the second memory partition on the stick, and I've long realized that using a Lexar stick didn't present any obvious difficulties or shortcomings compared to the more costly Sony stick the camera maker recommends. But I was unpleasantly surprised to discover that each of the two parts of the 256 MB device held significantly less than the 128 MB stick I used before.This is something I can't figure out, and I am not the kind of technical whiz who could accurately theorize why this takes place. But the evidence is clear: my 128 MB stick holds around 68 or 70 full resolution photos before filling up and on separate occasions, the 256 MB stick held about 55 or 56 on each side before it topped out. Both are from Lexar, so the problem is not problem stemming from the memory stick maker. And the 128 MB stick is older, so the blame can't be placed on any unannounced technological advances. The only thing I can assume is that the partitioning of the stick or the cataloguing of so much information somehow uses up some of the memory built into the product.Does that mean this product is a bad investment? Well, I'm not sad that I bought it. It more than doubles the total number of photos I can take without downloading, to around 190 from around 80 (counting the 16 MB stick that came with the camera) for what seems to me to be a reasonable price. But if you are buying this counting on having exactly twice as much space as you'd find on a 128 MB memory stick, I think you'll find this product comes up more than a little bit short."}

{"reviewerID":"A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ","reviewText":"Edit: this was a great drive a year ago for &lt;$180, but its been superseded by a number of drives for much less money.  I've picked up several drives like the Intel 530, Seagate 600 and others in the &lt;$130 range.  Mushkin needs to drop the price on this drive about $30 and warm over the content a little.  The controller is still good but there are better, and nand has also changed a bit in the last year.=============Solid state disk drives have 4 defining characteristics.  Its interface with the computer which limits what speeds it can attain in the real world, the type of controller chip used in the SSD, the type of memory or 'nand' and the firmware.  The firmware is software that is loaded onto the SSD and used by the controller chip to manage the storage device.This particular drive can use \"Sata III\" which allows for properly equipped computers to send data at up to 6Gb\/s.  If your computer uses Sata II or Sata I (it'd be pretty old to be the latter), you top out at 3 and 1.5Gb\/s respectively.Only the very fastest tiers of solid state drives can saturate more than Sata II, and you'd have to be doing some serious stuff on a sustained basis to make good use of the 6Gb\/s, so for most purposes it suffices to say that this drive will throw more data at your computer than it can reasonably handle.The controller is a Sanforce 2200 series.  This is a very powerful and advanced controller, but its suffered from being released early by many eager SSD providers putting it on the market before the firmware had all of the problems worked out.  As a result a number of drives with these controllers lost customer data and crashed systems.  The current firmware release, just dropped a short time ago by many manufacturers, seems to have all of these problems worked out.  There are a few products that suffer from manufacturing issues that affect reliability, but this is not one of them.As far as type of memory, there is 'toggle nand', synchronous and asynchronous, with varying speed tiers within type.  Toggle is fastest in general, then sync, then async.  But some fast sync drives can approach toggle speeds and some async drives can approach sync speeds.Firmware is the crucial element.  Well tested and researched firmware means reliability and performance.  Many of the more popular drives go through dozens of firmware revisions every year, most bringing reliability and performance improvements.According to Toms Hardware SSD hierarchy chart, this is a tier 1 drive with toggle nand, the fast 2200 series sandforce controller and pretty reliable firmware.  This is one of the 2-3 fastest drives on the market and with the current firmware it may be the fastest.  It offers excellent performance at a reasonable price point on sale recently with excellent reliability.  And like all recent SSD's, it offers silence, no moving parts, and ridiculously fast random access to your data.  Put it in an older computer and it feels like its gotten faster and newer.  Put it in a new computer and it'll fly.  Your statup, shutdown, program load and general usage will seem as much as twice as fast.  Even opening a browser with 15 tabs takes me half as much time with an SSD as a hard drive."}

Using GPS, I wonder if it could even last through an hour-plus run, although I haven't tried it.-Touch screen is a bit finicky, which is probably just due to the small size, but it's easy to touch the wrong thing and go to a screen you weren't trying for.-Wrist strap kind of dorky looking in my opinion.

{"reviewerID":"A3SHOGDIQLNOQJ","reviewText":"I bought this camera, a canon t2i, and a panasonic fz200 .  I used them all with and without a tripod, mostly on animals, bugs, and nature.  Out of the 3, I kept the Olympus.The panasonic fz200 was awesome.  Fun to use and took great pics.  The canon I was a bit disappointed in, mainly the autofocus time, and inconsistent auto color.  Maybe these things are beyond how much I have to fiddle with a camera.I took pictures with all of them, freehand and with tripod, and at home on the computer, I could not tell the difference in quality.  The Olympus has 12.3 megapixels, and the canon has 18, and I expected to be able to blow up and crop the canon pictures much more, but could not.  The pictures fell apart at the same enlargement as the other 2.  The panasonic was outstanding even without a tripod.  But those 2 were not any better then the Olympus Pen epl-1.  The other reason I chose it over the Panasonic is that I have to turn the lens itself for closer\/farther, where the panasonic had a toggle.  Hand on lens is far more quick and controlable when it comes to getting the distance you want.  I did not find that the autofocus took too long, but longer than my pocket camera.  With the canon, I more often missed the picture waiting for the autofocus to focus.I am not a professional.  But I enjoy seeing how good I can get a clear quality picture without being a professional.  And I am the blow-up and crop queen, it's extremely important to me.  The Olympus is up there equal to the best with less fuss.  The canon took too long to autofocus, and the Panasonic FZ200 was a hard one to give up, but turning the lens for distance on the Olympus was much more enjoyable than the toggle on the panasonic.Update 1\/24\/13Okay, I got curious.  I bought a Sony slt a57.  It was rated better than the pl1.  I went out and shot 120 pictures.  It did not beat the Pen epl1.  The clearest shots got blurry before they broke up with the Sony, as enlarged.  With the Pen the pictures break up first and do not get blurry.  The Sony seemed to have less than a focus area than the Pen.  Meaning that more of the outer edges of the item were blurry, whereas, the Pen gives a larger area of clarity without impeding on the bokeh or background blur.  The Sony is easier to use the menus, but the trade-off is the bulk. The Sony is easily twice the size and weight. The clear pictures with the Sony, I find , are a hair softer than the PEN. I can't see lugging that camera around my neck for the day.All my comparisons were done freehand with some enlargement and cropping of the picture.Meaning that they were only compared by making the pictured item closer up in the laptop picture edit.  And all were taken with the Auto program. All the cameras I tested had an upgraded lens.If I had to do it all over again, I would have not wasted my time comparing this awesome Pen e-pl1 to popular midrange DSLR cameras.  This Olympus PEN is majorly overlooked as a popular camera, which is great because you save a lot of money buying it.  It's a gem."}

The first thing WD's \"My Book\" did was to \"drop\" itself from my PC. It was always wandering off somewhere where my OS couldn't find it. I kept on having to disconnect it and connect it just to use it. The drive has decided - after these many weeks of losing itself in the ether - to stick around. How long will it stay? That's impossible to say.\"My Book\" (when its working) is noisy. It's as if the drive wants to be a turbojet when it grows up. It does get quiet between its tantrums, however, which is, I suppose, a redeeming quality.In addition, \"My Book\" has a nasty tendency to embed itself so deeply into the inner workings its host PC that the user can hardly do anything without it \"spinning up.\" Even surfing the net can be negatively impacted by \"My Book.\" Files are often directed without the user's volition or knowledge to this blue-eyed cyclops. Considering the data retrieval times associated with the drive, depositing critical files in the beastie is not a good thing.WD's \"My Book\" can be best described as a noisy vampiric tumor. It invades its PC host and degrades its performance. Still want all that memory?"}

{"reviewerID":"A2WKU6GBCADMOP","reviewText":"I absolutely love the rotated mobo arrangement.  Whoever decided it was a good idea to put the bulk of a computers plug-in ports at the back of the tower (which is typically tucked into some hard-to-reach corner) clearly didn't think things through.  I run a ton of components into my machine, and I'm often unplugging one item and swapping in another.  The top access to the mobo has made it 10x easier to switch back and forth between external components.  For that reason alone, I would recommend this case to anyone who needs to access the \"back\" plate of the mobo very often.The other thing that I was thoroughly impress with is the temperature performance.  My old case was a Raidmax Smilodon, and my CPU was typically running high 40's to low 50's (Celsius), and my GPU was running mid 50's (and the fan was NOT happy about it).  After switching the components over to this case, my temps for all components have dropped about 10 degrees, and I've got no more fan noise issue.  I don't have a dB meter, but the noise level in my office went from a level 3 hurricane to a quiet whisper.Another big plus about this case is its size.  That could also be viewed as a negative, depending on how you look at it or what type of arrangement you have.  LOOK AT THE DIMENSIONS BEFORE YOU BUY.  That's the best advice I can give.  Due to the 90 degree rotation of the mobo, this case is much shorter than a typical full tower, but it's also much deeper.  Unless you've owned a case with a rotated mobo layout, there's a good chance you've never worked with a case with these dimensions before.  The size also allows for some fantastic cable management.  I'm not an expert system builder by any stretch, but this case made it EASY to get a clean look with no cable clutter.Last thing, if you actually have a use for the hot swap bays, they are fantastic.  I have a ton of digital content due to being in the photography and videography business.  Rather than using external drives to store my data, I just use the hot swap bays, which saves a bit of time on data transfer speeds (vs USB), reduces clutter, and saves money (internal drives are typically cheaper than external).This is easily the best case I've ever owned, and I would highly recommend it if you've got the room."}

{"reviewerID":"A30Z0GG96D11EO","reviewText":"UPDATED JULY 2009!: After barely 6 months of use this LCD actually blew out.  We were watching television and all of a sudden everything went black... completely black.  Resetting, unplugging and even praying didn't work!  Luckily it was still under warranty and they came in a few days ordered a new screen and had it installed within a week.  The total would have been 1500 hundred out of pocket if it weren't for the warranty.  INSANITY!!  Honestly, after scouring the internet I have come across the same issue repeatedly where people are stuck with this paperweight.  Toshiba seems to not manufacter quality products that can make it past the first 12 months.  The only upside was that there was a service center 10 minutes away and everything was in-home (from the initial inspection to the actual work)... that was a plus not having to lug around the television.  You will need to have a dated receipt within 12 months and they will take pictures for service.I had purchased this set back in February 2008 and wanted to review after having it for awhile.This set with DVD player was purchased for our bedroom.  The picture quality is gorgeous and vibrant.  We have just moved and until we get our 42 inch Panasonic on the wall we have been using this one in the living room.  It more than suffices!  It looks amazing, that I could see someone using this one as a main tv if the room isn't too large.Unlike other LCDs, this one does not turn dark or grayed out when viewed from different angles.  The picture quality is amazing.  The colors are vibrant and bright and I feel as if it is able to get a \"true black\".As far as the DVD player... the reality is we have used it about 2 times; so I cannot review on the dependability.  I have read and experienced that Toshiba DVD players love to conk out.The frame is very sleek and sexy, just don't touch it with your oily fingers!  I wish I had purchased two when they were on sale because I can no longer find the combos anywhere.Again, if you can find it for a good price, jump on it.  You will not regret it.  Also wanted to mention that this set picks up an unbelievable amount of HD channels (about 90) without a cable\/satellite box.  We have service, but we always love to test the capability of the television."}

{"reviewerID":"A1TT1AOJVODKKJ","reviewText":"I'm not sure what the other reviewer was smoking but this case fits the Canon G10 PERFECTLY. Leather is sometimes a little stiff when it is new, so maybe that was their problem. Every professional photographer knows that you do not want a camera to fit loosely in a case, because whenever it moves around (even a little) it causes friction, and friction ALWAYS causes wear and tear. In any event this case is well made. There is a loop on the back of it so that you can wear it on your belt if you want. This would come in handy on vacations. The cases lid is held on by TWO forms, one is a standard snap closure, and the second is a magnetic action so that the snap doesn't accidentally come undone. The entire inside of the case is finished in very fine and smooth suede. Stitching is very nice and in some places it is even double stitched. There are recesses on each side of the case (around where the camera straps would be) so that you can easily grab the camera to remove it from the case. If you own a G10 then you will definitely want to own this case, even if you have another camera case with all of your other gear. You've probably spent a lot of money on your Canon G10, and this case is made to protect it from any wear, and that's a job that is does very well."}

It's just fine.In general, this is a no-frills device that does what it's meant to and mostly stays out of the way.  I'm no big fan of the low level of control iOS provides over display mirroring or resolutions, but that's not this device's fault - it's an iOS thing.After about four weeks using it twice a week in college, I can envision many more lectures (and presentations at work) beaming from my iPad with this device.

{"reviewerID":"A2CXKBB58MJDTZ","reviewText":"The adapter works well to connect the lens with my camera, although initially the camera refused to operate because of a \"communication error\" with the lens.  Because the adapter only cost about $15 more than the one without the chip, rather than shipping it back I removed the chip from the adapter.  The chip was only held on by what appears to be an epoxy, and came off effortlessly leaving me to suspect that it was making a poor connection.I encountered no other problems when using this adapter with the full frame \"Canon 5DmkII\", however it is somewhat difficult to attach and remove from my set of extension tubes.  The lens I use does not extend past the adapter however, and this may cause a problem with other lenses as mentioned by other reviews.If not for the problem with the chip, I would have given this 5 stars."}

I have owned about 20-30 other canalphones and the CK7 is my absolute favorite. The highs are sparkly and beautiful, the midrange presence is fantastic, and the bass has great impact without being \"boomy\" or overwhelming. These are fast little canalphones and are great for rock or metal since they can keep up with a double bass. I also use them to listen to Jazz and classical music. On a high quality recording you can even make out the impact of the piano keys or the fingers strumming the guitar strings. Wind instruments have a fantastic airy quality, usually only found on far more expensive headphones or speakers.The CK7 comes in a beautiful titanium housing that looks great and really protects the delicate drivers inside. I take good care of my electronics but they still tend to get tossed around since I use them almost every day. The CK7 has held up extremely well and looks as good as new.Also of note is that the CK7 has a \"Y\" shaped cord unlike the \"J\" cord which is popular with manufacturers these days but generally not with consumers.All in all anyone looking for an amazing pair of earphones with fantastic sound and decent isolation should check these out. You will not be disappointed.Just note that directly out of the box the CK7 can sound a bit harsh or shrill. Give them some time. The drivers need to be burned in, and after a few days of use they will really come into their own. You may want to let them play overnight before using them the first time."}

Projecting on to the seat in front of me vs. viewing on an Ipod screen was too much to resist. I had a $200 pricepoint and was tempted to get it and am pleased so far. My take:- It's not fair that a reviewer pointed out that you needed to remove a screw to put in the battery. Hard to believe the reviewer did not have something that would allow them to easily open this. I'm glad it's there as I have too many devices that have the battery door pop off.- The tripod is not an option - you really need this to position this for viewing. I have the one with the flexible legs that I use with a small video camera and it works great with the Mpro.- It's not intended as a replacement for a desktop projector and doesn't fill those shoes. The brightness is OK for what I need it for and better than other reviewers have reported.- The iPod connectivity is important to me. It comes with a male 1\/8 plug 'in' to the unit and a male RCA to take the video input. Thoughtfully it comes with a female to female adapter; for the Ipod you can use the video cable that you would use with a dock, etc. So it's male 1\/8 into the projector, male RCA, female RCA with adapter, to the male RCA plug out from the Ipod. This works but is way to cumbersome for my use. Instead I have purchased the retractable Ipod to male RCA and a connector that is female RCA on one side and male 1\/8 plug on the other.- You can use the headphone's jack as output even though the composite audio is connected.- Get an extension cable if you want to use it with VGA."}
{"reviewerID":"A2SBFXPN5V6A6X","reviewText":"There are more than a few positive reviews available on this  particular item and I must say that I agree with almost all of them. This is a fantastic lens for your Canon  camera. The images are nothing short of break taking and will make an amateur shoot like a pro. The ,\"L' lenses is what makes Canon the name it is keeping mind mind a lens makes the camera.Initially I had to drop this unit off at Canon in Orange County with my 30D for them to calibrate the lens to the camera. An otherwise sharp image got even sharper. This was done within warranty and thus no cost to me and something I recommend to everyone as there are always manufacturer spec discrepancies.The lens comes with a handsome case that offers very little protection so something stronger is recommended to protect this bad boy of a lens as a simple drop on a hard surface from 3' up guarantees damage to the lens while in the case.I normally stop down my images a full stop for best clarity and this lens is no different. Open wide the images are ok and could be a tad sharper but stepped down it works wonders and it very sharp through the entire field from edge to edge.The Image Stabilization is superb and works flawless. Quick and accurate under almost every situation though I did find some loss of lock when an object is approaching me such as my dog running towards me from 40 feet away.The build quality is above par and is typical of Canon L lenses. You get what you pay for here and you know where the money went. This is a solid piece of glass built like a tank. The while paint does scratch easily so be careful there.Keep in mind that this lens is heavy and requires that one hand is holding the lens and not just the camera. For tripod mount use the lens to mount and not the camera.Autofocus on fast moving objects is good and is equally good in low light situations. It also has a selector switch on the side for focus ranges for even quicker focusing.Overall I am very impressed with this lens as it continues a Canon tradition of great lenses.PROSGorgeous ImageryFast lens F\/2.8Quality lens.Fast focusLow light focus works greatGreat bokeyInternal focusingImage stabilization works greatThe WOW factorNice dust shieldCONSVery heavyScared to use in case it dropsSome focus lock on moving objectsNot sharp out of the box.Cannot remove lens cap with dust shield installed as you can with TamronOverall a fantastic lens that is highly recommended.

Technical support has been entirely unhelpful, claiming alternately that my computer is an Android, a \"custom built computer,\" and various other things (none of which are true -- I'm running Windows 8.1 on a Lenovo X1 Carbon), and implying I should just buy a new computer as they are not at fault for the driver issues I'm experiencing.At this point, I can't recommend Wacom products, as much as I like the idea, and as much as I've been a long standing customer. Until they clear up their driver issues, and can get their technical support problems ironed out, I can't recommend Wacom products.==Update: 3\/1\/2014It's been over a month since I first reported these problem to Wacom. It's been reported that the driver problems I've described are now fixed in the latest version of the Bamboo drivers, but the Intuous driver has not been updated. I have received a couple of emails from someone else at Wacom about this problem, saying they're \"working on it,\" but nothing in the last two weeks.At this point, I still can't recommend this tablet. You might be lucky enough that the drivers work. But if you're not, don't expect any sort of reasonable support from Wacom.==Update 3\/10\/20149 more days have passed; my last email from Wacom technical support was 2\/11, a month ago, from Sherri Egli-Doster. I'm currently in the process of researching another brand of tablet to purchase. I have consistently told Wacom Tech Support that I'm updating this review on an as needed basis, and that I would be glad to shift to a higher rating if the problem is fixed. So far, they don't seem to be too concerned about these driver problems.Overall, I still cannot recommend this tablet to anyone -- the tablet is completely worthless in Acrobat, and difficult to use in any MS Office package. I will not replace my computer to make the tablet work, as Wacom recommended; that's like the tail wagging the dog.Will continue updating as more information becomes available.==Update 4\/6\/2014Last response from Wacom technical support was the 12th of last month -- three weeks. I've now discovered, after trying to use internet explorer on a regular basis, that the right click button is not working there, either, and the normal (left) click is finicky at best; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.As soon as Wacom replies with some sort of reasonable answer to this situation, I'll be happy to update this review. Until then, Acrobat and IE are completely unusable with the Intuous, and Office (including Outlook) is only useful if you remember to move the pointer out of any office windows after clicking on something -- not very useful, to say the least. I've posted to Wacom's facebook page with no results (they didn't even bother to respond).Still not recommending this table to anyone. Wacom needs to fix their support issues.==Update 4\/8\/2014New version of the driver was released yesterday. It has fixed some issues (right click in IE is now working), but not others (you still have to move the cursor out of any office application for it to work properly, the Wacom is essentially nonfunctional in acrobat, and the cursors in IE are still a mess, as well as other functions with the Wacom in IE).I've reported these changes to Wacom (who actually responded to my last email, today!). Slight improvement, so I'm bumping up by one star. Still far from perfect."}

{"reviewerID":"A2LTEAUTDYHS85","reviewText":"This case is fine: it is a solid product.  I appreciate the quality of craftsmanship -- this case is not cheaply made and I've found all of the ports and switches are mostly accessible. It stays closed, and it looks pretty nice.  I'm not a big fan of the \"iLuv\" logo on the closure, but I can understand branding.My wife is the primary user of this case, and she upgraded from the Apple iPad2 cover: Apple iPad 2 Polyurethane Smart Cover - Gray (MC939LL\/A).  In her opinion, she likes the protection that this case offers, but feels that it \"confines\" the device and makes the buttons hard to get to.  Plus, she says it has a funny smell.  In my opinion, that is probably temporary, but I don't know for sure.My main complaint with it is that it seems to lack the magnet used to automatically sleep\/lock the iPad 2 when the case is closed.  I tried a few things here to see if I was missing something: 1) using the magnet from another case while the iPad was inside this case, 2) trying to stick a paperclip to the case in the right spot to see if there was even a magnet in the cover.  The paperclip sticks in what seems to be the right spot, but it appears that either the magnet is not strong enough to penetrate the thick case material surrounding the iPad when it is installed, or it is not in exactly the correct place to trip the iPad's sensor.  I have used the iPad2 Smart Cover we had to check this out and I am able to trip the sensor with its magnet while the iPad is in this case, so I'm leaning towards the weak or misplaced magnet rather than case thickness.My wife misses the ability to automatically lock the iPad and the upsides of having her iPad in this case don't seem to outweigh the downsides of more difficult to reach buttons\/switches and lack of auto-lock."}

{"reviewerID":"A16I8SQQIA2B8C","reviewText":"Great product.  I never thought a touchpad would be a superior replacement of a good mouse. But this is. Effortless, and multifunctional with a combination of one, two, three and four finger taps, clicks, slides and swipes.To properly configure and understand how to use this touchpad, it is very important to understand the difference between a tap and a click:- a \"tap\" is just a simple brief touch on the screen using one fingertip, completely effortless.- a \"click\" means you press one of the lower corners of the touchpad pretty hard.A tap is natural with a touchpad, while a click is something added to supplement the touchpad, so it would mimic a mouse.The default setting of this touchpad has two most basic things that are not only easy but also intuitive:(1) A one finger slide is the equivalent of cursor movement by a mouse. This is completely intuitive, especially for those who are already familiar with a touchpad on laptops.(2) A one finger tap then is the \"primary click\" (which is usually the left click on a mouse). This is also intuitive, except that this \"primary click\" based on a one finger tap is not completely identical to the \"primary click\" of a regular mouse. When the tap is used for clicking alone, it is indeed the same as the clicking of the mouse; but the tap cannot be held and combined with the cursor movement like the primary click of a mouse could. For example, you cannot use one finger to tap and hold it while sliding another finger to select text. To do that, you need to do a real hard-pressing \"click\" instead of a light tap.From there, the rest might need some getting used to. I read one user had a hard time to find where the \"right-click\" is. Well in the Logitech software, you can program it in a variety of ways. One way is a *click* (the hard-pressing click on one of the lower corners of  the touchpad); another way is a *tap* at the lower right corner (it cannot be a tap anywhere, for it would confuse with the primary click). Neither is completely intuitive, but it's not hard to learn. I am experimenting both but have not made up my mind. Because you also use other computers, you don't want to develop a habit which interferes with navigation of other devices.Because the touchpad is much more spacious than what you have on the laptop, it really does work much better.It is indeed better than even a great mouse. I've used a Logitech M500 for too long, and I have developed some painful fingers. This is not because the M500 is a bad mouse in any way, but because I have used it for too long with one particular type of finger gestures and motions. This practice is not healthy for anyone. So I decided to change to something that is very different, intentionally, out of health concerns for my fingers. So I was expecting some difficulties of adjustment. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well this works.ONLY COMPLAINTS I HAVE:The click (not the tap) is physically hard to do. You actually need to press it really hard and perhaps even need fairly strong fingers to do so. Pressing and holding is even harder.  Also, because it is a touchpad, pressing the surface frequently causes jump of the cursor position.(However, remember that the hard-pressing click on this touchpad is not essential, because you can program the touchpad to do everything using multi-finger taps and swipes without requiring the hard click. So this is just an imperfection, not the critical flaw.)Related to the problem of the click, although this touchpad is super easy to do other things, it is relatively difficult to do a simple text highlighting or an item drag-and-drop, which require a click, holding and drag.A tip: in the Windows Control Panel mouse setting, you can turn on the ClickLock function which enables you to highlight or drag without holding down the mouse button. I don't do this with a regular mouse and never felt any need of it. But with this touchpad, it may be almost necessary for the above reason.AN UPDATE:  I eventually decided to use this touchpad mostly handheld.  This works for me because I use speech recognition for typing. Probably not a good idea for others.  With the touchpad in your hand, a click is easy to perform because instead of pressing hard on the top surface of the touchpad, you simply click the rubber foot on the bottom of the touchpad.  Much easier to do."}

However, video quality is murkier in bright light and much less impressive in low light.  It performs poorly in low-light conditions. In decent lighting conditions, the Flip UltraHD captures subjects nicely with bright, exposed colors; and at 60 fps. Overall video quality is pretty good, mostly due to its respectable output in bright-light situations. Audio pickup through its on-board microphone was very good.As with any Flip camcorder, you don't get many recording options: The UltraHD offers smooth 2X digital zoom, and digital image stabilization which will not work miracles; also, you're limited to video-recording only. You can grab a frame from a video clip to use as a still image via the desktop FlipShare software, but the device itself doesn't take photos.Cisco's Flip UltraHD isn't very full-featured, but that's sort of the point. It definitely has its place, and it's a great option for children, the elderly, or anyone who just wants a quick way to shoot easily uploadable video without any fuse and sheer simplicity., For the price you can't beat it.  Well made, fits like a glove and give you the protection you need while keeping you portable by not adding much weight.  If you have a Kindle Fire HDX, this is a must have."}

I tend to be a bit of an audio snob but I'm using these on a cell phone and occasionally an Ipod. So I understand those aren't going to be able to push a lot of power in order to get a full range.Even with that being the case I was pleasently surprised with the efficiency of these. You don't have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound. Bass is very strong, it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste. I listen to a wide range, from classical, to Hip-Hop and for things like Jazz and Classical I find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay, the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced. This isn't to say they sound bad but for music demands with a high range then these aren't going to do as good as they would for something like Mos-Def for whom these are exceptional. The construction is pretty good though the design is very dated but I can live with that because I'm concerned about the sound it produces not how cute they are.If good sound is what your looking for at a great price just listen one time and you'll understand why they're considered classics.

It doesn't recognize \"new\" programs when you set it to record \"series\" recordings the way that a cable dvr does. The menu us cool but it takes some getting used to when dealing with it. Overall, this is a GREAT unit and has a ton of features. We haven't yet gotten to recording from VCR to DVD, but it does that too. It's pretty much a fool proof and user friendly system.

{"reviewerID":"A2OXTWJ4FTHF1","reviewText":"I had purchased some Mediabridge HDMI cables in the past and had good luck with them, so I decided to try their USB cable out after my Amazon Basics cable broke (after about 1 month of use).So far, I have been using this cable for about 6 months and haven't had any problems.  I also find it much more snug than other cables, even my original cable that came with device.  It's not so tight that I feel like I am going to break the connection, but also firm enough that I don't think if I move my device it will no longer charge (like my Amazon Basics cord did).  I mostly use it to charge my phone at night, so it is plugged in behind my bed and sits on my nightstand, with still enough length that I can grab it and do things while in bed.  The OEM cord is not that long.I have been very happy so far."}

{"reviewerID":"APIGMMRFWAO1L","reviewText":"I was shocked with the quality of this for &lt;$11.  I had been tempted to buy something more expensive to serve the same purpose - just because, at this price how good could it be?Well, it's excellent.It comes with a SATA slim to SATA internal adapter.It comes with a molex to floppy-type power adapter ( that then plugs into the SATA adapter.)It comes with a complete set of screws for the optical AND a HDD AND a floppy drive.The only drawback was - well, it was slightly bent on arrival due to being packed in a padded envelope instead of a box.  That was easily pushed back out - no real issue.I bought two - and now instead of two optical drives in my tower, I have two optical, a card reader with floppy and a 4 port USB 3.0 hub.If you're trying to put too many things in too small of a case, this is a proper piece of kit for the job!"}

Its gone.Be sure you check for any small foreign body as it will easily allow leaks (it sends a warning every time you use it)Be sure to check the locks. an open one allows leaks even if one lock is engaged (there are 2)Be sure to buy a silicon case. Its meant to for outdoor but the paints will flake when hit hardIts bulky. be sure to have a a carabiner hooked to your BC or life jacket (max depth 50 ft ) . or a buoy if you are just snorkelingbreaks your wallet if you lose it (quite expensive)Quite hesitant to use the flash as the metals might corrode.PROWorks like a DSLRI had the Nikon coolpix aw100. twice (the first one was so good my friend asked for it) but this one was far better. the olympus tough (first version) was my first outdoor camera. It worked well but water depth was an issue (max 10 ft). I used this cam for snorkelling, watching whale sharks and boy was the resolution so good. Its not meant for dives beyond 50 ft and the light at that point would have changed underwater. So a dive cam is a better for that. This cam is for family pics in beaches, snorkeling, island hopping or in any condition that you expect your camera to get wet yet still keep getting shots. 2 hours after water activity i went rappelling with the same camera.. started to condense on the lens (not the cameras fault as i should have soaked it in water in between dives) but as soon as this was settled the resolution was equal to an average dslr with minimal change in camera settings. I am not a pro in photography but just an enthusiast and have had 4 dslr (2 of alpha of sony and 2 of nikon) and this one was equally good with its current lens. the settings can be adjusted easily either in motion or menu (large icons easy to shift underwater).The technicals will be dealt by the pros who will review this camera. But for a diver and who love outdoors, other than its weight, this camera is worth it. Love it !"}

{"reviewerID":"A1U60HED4DKH4V","reviewText":"It finally works with the Verizon version of the Galaxy S3, but only if you use a version of their latest Android 4.1 leak (I had success using Synergy R90, which is available from the XDA website). This means that your phone needs to be unlocked and rooted. So if you're a casual user who doesn't know how to do these things (and doesn't want to learn), the Hub still won't work on your GS3. The good news is that it's a leak of the forthcoming official Verizon update, so it should work in the near future, whenever they decide to release the 4.1 update.I'm only giving it 3 stars because it's still a challenge to get it to connect and not quickly disconnect. The only way that works for me is to unplug the power to the Hub (reset button doesn't cut it), then plug back in so that it resets. Then reboot your phone and immediately use Allshare Cast in Settings to connect. Once it's connected, it works nicely and stays connected. Works great for everything but action games--a little too much lag for those. But it's nice for surfing the web, reading PDFs, watching videos, viewing photos, and stuff like that. Hopefully Verizon will come up with an update that connects more easily (it is just a pre-release leak that I'm using, after all)."}

{"reviewerID":"A1FCMWIRX04X5B","reviewText":"fantastic if you are a computer junkie that wants to make understanding this device a hobby.  Disappointing if you like to turn things on and use them with minimal setting up.First, you would think can use the web cam for skype, you can't, nor on gizmo.  In fact you cant use it at all without finding some camera software online and it only works unit to unit Im told. (maybe this will change) Skype calls take forever to connect and you sms is not supported either.second, you can't control or use any feature without the appropriate software, sure, thats a given right?  Unfortunately understanding what software to get and how to install and use it will take hours and then be prepared for allot of failure.  I have given up on so much of the functionality.  Nokia has little or no info about this on their site.third thing is I that although it supports .AVI, it only suports some versions of the file formats. Mone of my .avi's work, regardless of resolution or settings. I had to download nokias beta movie conversion software for this to work.forth, the GPS mapping software is off by nearly a mile, in spite of the good signal, this may be due to the calibration of the maps in my area.All in all a good gadget, but don't be fooled by promises of what it can do.If all you want it for is surfing the net (youtube,etc, then I don't think you will be disappointed.Now there are some good features and software you may like if you have time on your hands to get them to work."}
{"reviewerID":"A2WLNSZ9U0T1S3","reviewText":"HI All,First off, let me start by saying that I am a Canon fan-boy.  I love their product lines in the point and shoot category.  I have owned several Canon Powershots and this is my newest acquisition.Basics:Whats in the Box:CameraHand StrapBatteryChargerUSB CableAnalog Video CableDocumentationCanon Software version 46Whats NOT in the Box and Should be:Mini-HDMI to HDMI CableSample Memory CardONLY GRIPE:The NOT portion above automatically pulls this review down to a 4 star.  Why? Because if you are going to put a mini-hdmi port on your camera...you should include the cable.  Even CREATIVE includes a mini-hdmi to hdmi cable with their Vado Video Cam.  Come on CANON!  And no memory card to start playing out of the box..whats up with that?  $349 for this camera would surely be able to give Canon enough to throw in a memory card..and cable.  Enough Gripes...now on to the good stuff.PROS:I love the look of this camera.  Take a look at the images I have attached and ascertain for yourself.  Canon has refined the lines on their power-shots so much so that they look like professional cameras.From the time you press the power button to the time you take your first shot is about 1 second...which to me is pretty fast.  Turning the camera off takes an extra second or so because it has to put the flash back down and bring the lens in.The zoom (12x optical zoom) is amazingly fast when compared to other cameras (Lumix TZ5) that have a lens that is about this size.  When the optical zoom runs out, it does get a bit slow on the digital zoom...but that is to be expected on all cameras.  I timed about 1.6 seconds from wide-angle to telephoto at full speed.  It moves faster as you put more pressure on the switch.  The range is 28-336mm.  NOTE: One of the cons here is that this amazing zoom can not be used for Video shooting.A fully charged battery should give you about 280-300 shots depending on conditions, flash usage, light compensation, etc.The face self-timer option lets you be in a photo, without having to sprint across the room while the self-timer counts down. The camera will simply wait until any other face is detected, and it will take 3 shots in 2 seconds.The custom self-timer option lets you select both the time you need and how many pictures you want to take.  Awesome feature.The Optical Image Stabilization is awesome and works really well.The LCD (which is an issue on most cameras for bright outdoors) is amazingly bright and high quality.  It is easy to see what you are shooting indoors under heavy lighting and outdoors.One of the few cameras in its class that allows you to use it in FULL Manual mode...although it does not save files in RAW format.HD video at 1280 x 720 (720p) at 30 frames\/second, with mono sound in h.264 format...which means more video due to higher compression.Amazing automatic red-eye removal....tested on my daughter with eyes that will put any cameras red-eye feature to shame.  We finally dont have to do any post editing on her eyes.  YEAH!!!I will be getting in to photo related details once I have had more time to experiment with the different shooting environments.  So far I can see that this camera shines in bright light but seems to have some noise that causes detail loss over iso 200 in low light.  Keep checking on this review for updates.Cons:Again, no included memory.No HDMI cable.Battery Life could be better (not a deal breaker).Flash takes a bit of time to charge after firing.Optical zoom not usable in video mode (my lumix tz5 allows it)Low light performance is lack luster..there is some detail loss.As I mentioned above..this review is a work in progress and I will be updating it regularly as my experiences with this camera increase.  Please ask any and all questions via the commenting system here and I will answer them to the best of my abilities..  Thanks and I hope this review is informative., I love my iPad and want to make sure that my investment is protected for a long time to come.  When I first bought the iPad I went looking for multiple cases for it and read dozens of reviews.  The Apple case is quite useless, in my opinion and others are just not up to par.  Yes, all cases do the job of protection but they all miss out on the functionality piece that is necessary when using a device like the iPad.For example:  I travel quite a bit and I want to be able to use my iPad on the plane to watch\/consume media.  Previously, I had to get creative to prop the device up to the right angle so I could view videos, avoid glare, and avoid neck strain.  I have tried other cases that have prop functionality built in..but none were quite perfect.Mophie has taken a new approach...they simply use velcro to help the device stand at the right angle for you..the consumer.  Slip your iPad in, prop it up, and enjoy.As for the color - personally I feel orange is a bit cool....its not the usual spectrum of colors you would see.  I like the fact that its a bit different then most people would use and it makes it for a little fun conversational piece...people will generally stare at your device.  The leather is of great quality - somewhat grainy, which adds the perfect texture.I give this product 5 STARS but I would hope that the price comes down a bit so everyone can afford these types of cases."}

{"reviewerID":"A3JGMJJY66INPS","reviewText":"The excellent look of glowing blue touch-controls on a one piece gloss black screen compliments the sound quality of this tiny little player. 320kbps mp3s sound incredible on this player (using Sony MDR-7506 headphones). I have not tested the included ear buds, so I have no idea if they're any good.The slide-out speakers are a very cool feature. They actually do a good job of reproducing most types of music, given their size. Bass response is even more surprising. It's actually pretty good!When the speakers are out, the screen switches its visualizations from vertical to horizontal. The FM radio system is also very nice. It uses a preset mode, in which you can simply tap the left and right arrows to cycle through your list of preset stations. Also, you must have the headphones plugged in or else the FM radio will not get reception. You can also listen through the built in speakers by sliding them out.Due to the 4GB of space and no expansion options for extra memory, it's probably not for everyone. But if you don't need to bring your ENTIRE music collection with you at all times, this is the player to get."}

{"reviewerID":"A1JK9LH9S7G7G9","reviewText":"I recently purchased the Ceton InfiniTV 4 to stick it to 'the man' and save some cost when it comes to DVR service and cable boxes.My service provider, as with many others, charges for the DVR service despite the fact that the DVR boxes being 'free'.  In addition, the DVR box that my provider has only has 2 tuners, so if you are watching one thing, you can only record up to one other channel.Enter the Ceton InfiniTV 4.The InfiniTV4 with its 4 tuners has been a welcome addition to my home.  In addition to saving money over additional cable boxes from my provider, I've been able to add all the shows I want to the recording schedule in Windows Media Center and never miss a thing.There are some things to mention about this though.First, if you plan on building an HTPC, you need to be aware of all the possible issues that could arise.  There are a number of places to go to research these, including the AVS Forums, The Green Button TV forums, and The Missing Remote forums.  I wont bother getting to far into that right now, but the best thing I can say is do your research.Second, the macroblocking issue that this device experiences can be a minor annoyance.  What this means is that while you're watching TV, you may experience small amounts of discolored boxes that flash on-screen for about 1 second every now and then (not too frequent).  Apparently Ceton is working on this issue, and they arent the only one plagued by this issue (the Silicon Dust HD Homerun Prime also experiences this).  I've not been too bothered by it, but it is definitely something I've noticed.Third, the installation of the device is slightly convoluted and may take a little massaging to complete.  Not only does it take dealing with your cable company to get the CableCARD paired with your device, but the InfiniTV 4 itself can take a little bit of effort to function entirely properly.  That's not to say it hasnt been well worth that effort, but I think the installation process could be better streamlined, or at least better described so when certain things happen, they wont be unexpected.  I've taken some of the issues I had to be normal as I've experienced them in the exact same order more than once when I had to reinstall the device.Fourth, you may run into the occasional 'tuner unavailable' or 'weak tv signal' issue because of the need of an SDV Tuning Device from most cable TV companies.  These devices tend to be a little bit flaky.  To get around it, I've actually attached mine to a 24 hour light timer so that it resets every morning.  Its not perfect, but it helps.Other than that, however, I've been happy with it.  The availability of 4 tuners to my recording needs and the capability of adding additional extenders without continuing to pay out the nose to the cable co has been a welcome result.So the bottom line is this:  If you have the desire to learn and dont mind a little bit of a learning curve while accomplishing your own in-home DVR functionality, this device is about as good as they come.  I've enjoyed the project despite some of the pitfalls."}

{"reviewerID":"A1R3VSOOBW5H7T","reviewText":"All digital camera's force you to make trade-offs...it's the hard cruel fact of personal photography. The Coolpix S3, has been a near perfect grab and go camera for the four photographers in our family. Picture quality, to our eyes, is great! When compared to our Rebel XT or D70 cameras, the S3's shots loose a bit of information but only through comparison to much more expensive equipment. This camera is VERY easy to use for those new to digital photography. The pre-programmed scenarios are easy to access and provide great shots. The camera has proven sturdy, and survived a couple bumps and bruises without drama. We always keep it in the ballistic nylon case, though, to protect the screen.  I'm convinced that many of the problems people cite about the S3 (or S1)are the result of unfamiliarity with using the camera's features more-so than a defect in the camera (save the white-spot issues which we have not observed to date). Red-eye reduction is semi effective but no more than in any of the dozen newer cameras that are in our hobby room. The free online photo editors cure red-eye much better than any of the in-camera solutions. If you're looking for a digital camera that can always be at-hand and deliver a great photo, the S3 should be on your list to check-out!"}

With its moderate wide angle to moderate telephoto, it is a great lens to use for a lot of every day situations, particularly those with family and friends.  It is lightweight (only about 14 ounces), so it is easy to carry around. The autofocus is very responsive.  I love the pictures that I have got with it--bright and clear.  All of this at the price for which Amazon sells this lens is a great deal.  The only drawback for me on the lens was the lack of image stabilization.  Nikon, however, does sell a similar lens with a image stabilizer, but it will cost you more."}

Definitely DON'T buy a used cable from Amazon Warehouse!I then called my office IT staff (no, I don't have any sort of real access to my work computer) and they remotely logged onto my computer. they followed the Windows 7 64 bit 'wizard' for finding the correct driver.  That honestly took close to 5 mintues!  in the meantime, he looked on HP's website, and downloaded what they said was the correct driver.  went back to the 'wizard' and either the manual download worked, or the wizard finally found it.

{"reviewerID":"AOEAD7DPLZE53","reviewText":"I have been using several USB 2.0 card readers in the past, including theTranscend M5 Multi-Card ReaderandSandisk Mobilemate SD Plus Memory Card Reader. With memory cards getting faster over the years, I started to get the feeling that my old card readers are limiting the Read\/Write speed of my newer memory cards. That's why I purchased thisTranscend Information USB 3.0 Card Reader (TS-RDF5K)just to try it out, even through all my computers only have USB 2.0 ports.Upon arrival of the RD5F, I benchmarked over one dozen of my SDHC and microSDHC memory cards, with speed rating from class-4 to class-10 and UHS-1. The program I used is called \"CrystalDiskMark v3.01 x64\". It reports, among other things, sequential READ and WRITE speed of memory cards. To my surprise, several of my fastest cards showed about 50% improvement in Read\/Write speed compared to when using the old M5 card reader.As an example: for theHP CG790A-AZ 32 GB Flash Memory Card Class 10 SDHCI was previously getting 19.6MB\/s in Write and 20.1MB\/s in Read. But when used with the RDF5, its throughput jumped 50% to 29.7 and 34.8MB\/s, respectively. TheTranscend 32 GB Class 10 UHS Flash Memory Card TS32GSDHC10U1Ealso shows nearly identical improvement.The above proves that using old card reader was the bottleneck for my fastest cards. On the other hand, improvements for my slower cards were less noticeable, typically around 5% or less. That includeKingston class-4 SD10G2\/16GB,Transcend Class 6 TS16GSDHC6E, etc. See the summary of benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section for details.The only negative about this RDF5 card reader is that: it does not allow simultaneous usage of both SDHC and microSDHC slots. That is, you can only insert one card at a time, but never both.Conclusion:I am very happy with the dramatic improvement I can achieve with this card reader, even when it is connected to an USB 2.0 port. Once I upgrade to a new computer with USB 3.0 ports, I expect the benchmark results to be even better - at least for my fastest cards. In the mean time, I consider this card reader the cheapest computer upgrade I can recommend.[Update on Dec 26, 2013]I finally have a computer with USB 3.0 port, so I re-tested ~10 memory cards to see the difference.- For any card marketed as 'UHS-1', I observed huge improvements in both Read and Write speeds.- For any card marketed as 'class 10' but not UHS, I may see some increase in Read, but very little difference in Wrire.Bottom Line: If you have an UHS-1 card, make sure to use the RDF5 card reader in conjunction with USB 3.0 port, in order to get the full benefit."}

{"reviewerID":"A28GTX82LNA9VA","reviewText":"One of my old 4GB Sandisk Cruzers died and I need to find something faster, more storage, cheaper, and would withstand being stored on a keychain.One of the reasons I loved my old 4GB \"slow\" model is because I replaced the standard keyring with a robust one from a crafts store. This made sure that they didn't fall off my keychain due to flimsy bent metal. I was really annoyed with all the rubber loop model usb keys and the ones with caps that come off.Because of my requirements, this fit the bill perfectly. I have tested write speeds and they come in at around 10-15 MB\/s and around 20-40MB\/s read.Also with some other \"slide out\" style usb keys, they wear out easily and become difficult to actually put in a computer because the usb connector just slides back when you push on it. This model how ever clicks into place. You can feel it securly lock. I had no issues with my old one, however the old one weas definately less secure and there was a lot of wiggle room."}
{"reviewerID":"A37PIZRG4KMACF","reviewText":"Review of the HP Dreamscreen 100 (10\" wide screen)by Vance JochimNov. 30, 2009I was in Best Buy looking for a picture frame and encountered the HP Dreamscreen 100 - the plus for me was that it played Pandora, and looked very nice.  It was the Saturday after Black Friday and they must have had some left from the Black Friday sale and the price was $149, not the retail $249.  I had to get the clerk find one under a counter.  (You can also get a more costly Dreamscreen 300, which apparently is no different from the model 100 except the screen is 13\" (diagonal), rather than 10\".  That reminds me of my first TV which had a 13\" screen.I have been using a five year old HP TC1100 tablet for a Pandora player, but it has horrendous delays when turning on, and this Dreamscreen is much, much faster...hardly any bootup time.  Amazingly, the TC1100 has become a cult machine and many people are upgrading the internals with ram etc. because they like the 10\" and form factor.  Since the tablet is touchscreen, and also has a 10\" screen, I was used to the form factor.  You can get a used TC1100 on ebay for under $500 if you want one, or a netbook to do more expanded computer functions.  But, this HP Dreamscreen seems to do much of what I was using the TC1100 for WITHOUT the loading delays of the tablet, and seems to have some of the upper scale industrial design familiar to TC1100 users.The packaging was upper scale, and very presentable in the provided heavy duty black box for a gift.  It reminds me of the \"packaging experience\" that Apple would do.Other reviews have talked about the tiny remote, which is limited, and the delay after clicking is frustrating.  Here are some comments:- The limited instructions focus on setting up a wifi connection, but I had a hard cable connection, and had to experiment with the menus, which did provide a method to set it up.- Video Tutorials:  You can reach them through the main \"Video\" icon, or on the provided CD-Rom.  There are seven of them plus a Dreamscreen tutorial.- Pandora:  I am listening to my Pandora channel of Christmas music right now on the Dreamscreen.As others have mentioned, you have to setup Pandora on a full computer, creating music channels, but they you can access it with the Dreamscreen.  My only Pandora gripe is that the remote or onscreen soft buttons don't have the normal Pandora PAUSE function, thus you can mute sound, but not halt playing, which Pandora doesn't like because they pay fees to artists to play the music, and only want it running when you are actually listening.  Normal Pandora users will pause the playing if they leave so as not to use up minutes for \"free\" accounts, but there is no such option here. The Pandora feature also shows the album cover, but not details about artists and other info available on the regular computer client.  The only way to halt (not mute) Pandora is to go to the main menu and choose another function which shuts off Pandora.  It is almost like they have only three window or memory partitions - one for the current application function, one for graphics like pictures (i.e. screensaver or slideshow), and one for the main menu.  But if you want to switch applications, it shuts off the current one.- Reviewers have complained about entering data.  The Dreamscreen doesn't have a keyboard (but there is a USB port - I wonder if a USB keyboard would work?), so they use an onscreen keyboard and you click each key by using the remote to move the cursor. That is very similar to the onscreen keyboard on the TC1100 tablet, so it was not new to me.  Hp should provide ability to use a USB or wireless keyboard, if it doesn't exist now.- I too find the lack of multiple windows or operations to be a weakness.  You can run your photos as a screensaver or by clicking the photos icon AND Pandora still plays.  While listening to Pandora, I held down the back button and got the main menu of feature icons. Once I clicked on Clock, the Pandora stream quit.  That is obnoxious, and needs to be fixed.  You should be able to keep one audio stream going while working with any of the other non-audio features.- When I setup the Dreamscreen, I found the software update button, and it replaced the Sept., 2009 software with a downloaded new version, so some problems reported in early reviews might have been fixed.- Some people complained about the speakers - I find them better than any laptop speaker (and definitely better than the HP tablet), and there is a headphone port to use for headphones or external speakers.- There is an alarm feature, and it can turn on and off at specific times you mention. I have not used it yet to see if it starts playing Pandora, but I imagine it would.- Some people complained about the thickness - it is about 1.5\" thick, with two holes in the back for hanging on nails, and the thick part is in the center of the unit, now out to the edges, so i think it is not a problem.- The unit stands up by screwing in a 4\" metal rod in the back that acts as a leg to keep the unit upright.  Thus it is easy to remove and carry the unit if you wanted - so if you have wifi and electricity in the back yard or boat dock, you could easily move this out there.- Facebook - as soon as you click the Facebook icon, the audio from Pandora stops.  After using the onscreen keyboard and cursor to enter your login info, you get a menu bar for \"Status Updates, Photos & Events\".  The Status update is default and shows updates from friends.  For the first time, it only showed the most recent four status updates. Photos - it only showed Photos of friends, but maybe because I have never uploaded any photos.  Events: It got a message no events found - probably because I have not created any on the account. I don't use it much. It doesn't provide any ability, even with the graphic keyboard to enter or modify Facebook data, so probably enabling the password isn't bad.- Radio - The feature of \"HP Radio\" says you can connect to radio stations around the world.  The station picker is very limited.  You can only select stations by \"location\" country, or \"genre\":. For \"location\", you can only pick a country (not city or zip) from a drop down list, so I chose USA.  Then if you pick to select by station name, you get a horrendous, alpha list of stations and you can't just enter the call letters.  You have to scroll through sublists 50 at a time.  Another reviewer said you couldn't go to the next group of 50 selections until you clicked DOWN on the last entry of the current group. There is no \"end of group\" jump button.  Additionally, the STUPID sort algorithm sorts based upon the first character, then the second.  Thus for numeric stations, you get all the 120 stations mixed in with the 1200 stations. This is NOT an intuitive feature and needs vast improvement.  You would have to SLOWLY scroll through many groups of 50 to reach station XYZ.  There are a lot of generic internet stations like \"181.fm Christmas Swing\" and you can click on stations to \"add\" them to your favorites. So, it isn't too hard to find generic stations, but if I want to hear the Orlando talk radio station WDBO 580am with Neal Boortz, it would be a REAL pain to find it.  Nothing tells you what the limit of \"favorites\" is, nor does it show a count of how many you add to favorites.  It contains the AOL stations for jazz, and \"ATC\" airport tower audio channel, etc.  I finally stopped at the end of the numeric stations and \"A's\" which were the first 400 I scrolled through.  There really needs to be a full search function for this, or a way to set favorites via the computer and internet.  I look forward to finding a forum where someone figures out how to set the radio stations much faster.  Once you have selected some \"favorite\" radio stations, that is the list you get when you click the main \"HP Radio\" graphic on the main menu.- USB keyboard - I moved a USB keyboard from my HP TC1100 tablet to the Dreamscreen and plugged it in while the Dreamscreen was on.  No indicator or message came up.  I then entered Facebook to setup my account, which normally would pull up the onscreen cursor controlled graphic keyboard.  I tried the USB keyboard both in the email login field, and also after clicking that field to see the onscreen keyboard, but the USB keyboard did not work in either instance, and did not generate any types of errors.  I turned the unit off, then back on, and repeated the above tests, and the USB keyboard still did not work. So, HP seems to have turned of any keyboard capability, and I think they should provide it to use with USB keyboards and mice like a wireless unit.- Real estate - one advantage of this unit is it does NOT take up much space on a desk, or you can hang it on a wall.  Imagine having a wireless keyboard and mouse option.- Memory - The model 100 comes with 2gb standard (not upgradeable) memory, but only 1.5gb is accessible to the user.  Thus I would get a USB or other memory stick like CompactFlash to provide more storage for pictures or videos.  I don't know if the unit can access a USB external hard drive.  Additionally, if you connect the unit to a PC with supplied software over a HOME NETWORK, you can play pictures or sound (not video) by streaming them from the PC over the network to the DreamScreen.  Thus if you had wifi, you could stream music from your PC to the Dreamscreen anywhere that the wifi would reach.- Videos:  THERE IS NO PAUSE FOR VIDEOS, JUST LIKE NO PAUSE FOR PANDORA. That is stupid.  If you press back, it starts the video at the beginning.  That is not in the simple documentation.  I got a phone call and could not pause the video tutorials - I could only press mute and then restart the video after the call was over.  If I press the left button, it jumps back some frames, but there is no smooth back or fast forward.  UPDATE:  The video tutorial said if you press the \"OK\" button, it will pause.  If you press the OK button again, the video will continue.  They need to relabel the \"OK\" button to \"OK \/ Pause\"- Picture files - only supports JPEG, BMP and PNG.- Email - there is no internet browser or email function, but I would think that could easily be added in the future.  Remember the old WebTV application, which was similar to the 40 character wide early AOL screens, and it worked with a phone modem and TV - this could supply the same thing to seniors who only want the basic stuff and don't want too complex a gadget.  (Note: While viewing the video tutorials, the speaker said that for most applications, you cannot enter data (only login info), thus internal circuitry might not exist to use an external keyboard or to enter data for email, etc. (at least in this model).- Bluetooth - there is no Bluetooth feature.- The remote unit is pretty flimsy.  I would find out how to get a spare, or how to use a generic remote as a backup (although you can click onscreen soft buttons like the remote as a backup).  It uses one of those thin batteries about the size of a nickel. I would get a spare battery before you need it.  And, provide an optional plastic BRIGHT ORANGE \"skin\" to hold the remote so you can find it on a desk.  The default black finish makes it hard to find!!- Power on - the button is on the remote, and if you powered off, it returns to the prior screen when powered backup.  If you lost the remote, there is a power on lighted button on the back.- USB - there is both a normal and mini USB port on the back, as well as a standard 10\/100 LAN hard cable port.- Provided CD-Rom - The CD is NOT for software to be loaded to the Dreamscreen, but is loaded to your desktop or other PC to enable streaming files to the Dreamscreen over a provided USB cable.  It also contains video tutorials and a UQuick start guide and User guide for the Dreamscreen.  When I ran the \"Install PC Software\" on my Sony laptop, it read the CD, then returned to the menu.  I tried launching it again, and it generated a \"HP Dreamscreen PC Updater\" error message, and sent an error report to Microsoft.  There are seven WMV file format video tutorials on the CD.  I always copy such configuration CD's to the hard drive and then run them from there.- Password controls:  When entering your login id and password, you have to decide if you allow the system to always enter your login with password each time you enter a service like Facebook, or not.  Thus because it is a pain to use the cursor to enter the password, and you leave the login enabled as automatic, anyone could login to your Facebook account using the Dreamscreen.  So you need to know what the Dreamscreen can do in your facebook account if you leave it with automatic login.  Note:  I found you can use the onscreen soft keys to also enter the password, if you don't have the remote.- Screen resolution is 800 x 600 (not the highest, but ok on this 10\" screen), and the format is widescreen or 16 x 9 ratio format.  The provided sample pictures have all been croped to the 16 x 9 format so they fill the screen. If your pictures are regular 4x6 or 3x5, or have been cropped to be taller than wide, they will not fill the screen.  Thus you either see them as they exist, or maybe create a group of picture files cropped to fit the 16x9 format and use all the screen.From the HP online FAQ page: When playing a slide show within Facebook's photos, some photo edges are cut off because the photo does not fit on the screen; and there are no options to force photos to fit the screen.The default setting for photo display on the HP DreamScreen is Fit to screen . If you wish the photo to display without cropping off, set the photo display to Original in the Photo Options Dialog box. In some cases the photo is cropped off when photo display mode is set to \"Fit to screen\", such as displaying 4:3 photo in horizontal mode.- Battery backup - some people have pointed out that the Dreamscreen does not have a backup battery, but it did retain my clock settings when I unplugged it overnite. There are no details on how that is done, or how long it would last.  Or, maybe the settings are stored on the internet and loaded upon being turned on?  I have no idea.- Additional Uses I would like to see:1) The main menu is setup with icons you scroll through to launch applications. It would be interesting to know if software upgrades could add more applications such as google mail, YouTube, Hulu, etc.  Or, maybe if HP was smart, they would allow developers access to the code to create some tailored applications called up by a new icon.2) I can see copying videos here for your own portable You Tube or presentation system where you just need to play a video with good sound.  Yes, you can use a laptop or netbook, but this unit has such nice design, it would look nice in an office.3) HULU & Netflix - if they could provide feeds to Hulu and Netflix accounts, that would be superb.4) Widgets - if you could add Yahoo widgets, that would be interesting.5) Games - There are no games and no controller.  Maybe a WII type of add on to run older legacy games from a memory card?I think this Dreamscreen is a gadgeteers dream machine if HP started providing add on programs and features like iPod does.  Some of the reviews say this product is an early, limited competitor to an expected Apple tablet pc, but it does not have a touchscreen and other features of a tablet like a TC1100, but what if HP used the same internals and then offered a whole range of options to add stuff - kind of like the Ford Mustang in the 1960's (or the new one).For more info, look at the guides on the CD, and also visit the HP online web page for the Dreamscreen and read the FAQ's and info at [...]Enjoy.vj"}

It was fine until a couple weeks ago, it just quit working. I thought it was the battery and put in a new one. That did not fix it. I started and restarted computer, took out and reinserted dongle, even tried different computers. It just will not work. It is a real shame because I really liked using it.I still want to give kudos to Anker customer service and if you should need any help, don't hesitate to contact them.  However, since this is my second mouse and I see that many other reviews share the same problem, I don't think I will ask for another replacement.  I do hope Anker does keep working on this and improves it.UPDATED REVIEW:  after posting my original review, I was contacted directly by Anker, the manufacturers of this mouse. They were apologetic, explaining that even with their rigorous quality control, sometimes an un-usable unit may slip through.  They asked if I would be willing to give the mouse another try, they would be willing to send me a replacement.  Since the mouse did seem nicely made and had seemed very comfortable, I agreed.  Well, I just got the replacement today.I am very happy to say that this one works wonderfully!  It is truly plug-n-play, but I still think some sort of quick start instructions should be included for users who may not be computer savvy. The body is ergonomically designed and lets my hand rest on it naturally & comfortably.  The keys are easy to reach and use.  I have had no wrist or hand fatigue after using it for several hours.I was hesitant about the side keys, thinking they might be in my way, but instead, they are very accessible without being in the way.  The tracking seems to be right on point, no lag at all.  I have not had to adjust cursor speed, it works very smoothly.  It tracks over just about any surface I have tried so far.The receiver is small and unobtrusive.  I can leave it in my laptop all the time, even when I pack up my computer for travel.  The receiver also can be stored inside the bottom of the mouse - a very convenient feature if you would be more comfortable doing that.I am very impressed with this little critter!  Lots of features, comfortable & easy to use, smooth tracking - all at an unbelievable price-point.  Top that off with some outstanding customer service and it cant be beat!With all this, I just had to get on here and update my review! I say this is a 5 star product. (because of my personal experience with getting the dud first, I would have to say only 4 stars for overall experience)  The customer service at Anker is definitely 5 star however!I highly recommend this mouse and the Anker company.  Now that I have had such a great experience with them, I can't wait to try the other products they offer!ORIGINAL REVIEW:  ordered this because of great reviews.  it was delivered quickly so i was happy with that. unfortunately nothing else to be happy with.  it looked nice and the ergonomic shape felt good in my hand. but there were no instructions whatsoever.  i put in battery and when i plugged in the receiver, the driver did not install automatically like it was supposed to.  the mouse did not respond at all.  i went to ianker.com to download the driver. that did no good either.  took battery out and put it back in, it responded for about 8 seconds then shut off and would not respond again.  took battery out & put back in again, same thing - worked for a few seconds then quit.  tried moving battery inside, but it still did not work.  it may be a great mouse, but the one i was sent is a real dud.  am returning it and getting a microsoft mouse."}

Honestly, too much is dependent on the volume of traffic from other users, & also what site you happen to be on.

{"reviewerID":"A2UROY0K0FF5DK","reviewText":"The very first words in the instruction manual are \"Thank you for purchase this mount.\" Let's be honest, you want to buy this because it's cheap and functional, not because it's fancy. At $30, this is far cheaper than other alternatives, and it gets the job done.Pros: Cheap, strong, and it really is universal. I've read that it doesn't fit a few types of projectors, but I did not have any problems with mine. It comes with several extra screws of various sizes to fit into your projector, and honestly you could just as easily buy new screws that fit and still come out ahead. Due to the angle of my studs, I had to mount it sideways, and it still gave me enough options to properly angle it to match the screen. And this mount is definitely sturdy. You may be skeptical that a mount this cheap could be strong, but I have no fear that my projector will fall. Ever. You could use this thing for pull-ups if you wanted. You can also skip using the extendo-rod if you have a short ceiling, or else use the 1-2ft optional rod to meet your needs.Cons: Terribly written instructions. You kind of have to wing it a bit, but it's still worth dealing with the assembly. Some pieces are glossed over, some are needlessly complicated, and the order of construction is a bit wonky. There are a million washers that all look the same, but you'll figure out their system soon enough. The screws it comes with are of very poor quality, and I ended up stripping both. So either this projector will be on my ceiling forever, or I'll have to replace the screws (which is still cheaper than going to another mount).All in all, I am very happy with this purchase. I would rather put in a little work and save $50-100 than go with another mount. I don't expect this thing will ever break, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to mount their projector."}

I thought it was broken, but apparently my old motherboard was fried (which may have been why the old power supply wasn't working, now that I think about it...)  Once I replaced the MB (and got a nice CPU and memory upgrade :) it worked beautifully.  Word to the wise--for (possibly) safety reasons it will not work just by plugging into alone into a wall outlet, it must be connected to a working motherboard for it to turn on.It has a quite liberal amount of 5V (and other types of) connectors--far more than I needed.  The materials are also pretty sturdy\/well-built workmanship."}

The screen is bright and looks great! The keyboard is comfortable and feels nice when doing a fair amount of typing.The only problem I've had is the mouse pad. It's a little hyper-sensitive at first and it's hard to find a good setting that makes it easy to use. However, this is easily fixed with a wireless mouse and the multi-touch functions are very useful!I don't know what everybody's issue with Windows 8 is, it just takes a little bit to get used to it. If you don't like it, just install Win 7, it's not that hard to come by.And well, it just looks cool.

I just bought theSony MDR-XB500 40mm XB Diaphragm Driver Extra Bass Headphonesfor listening at home\/work and not on the go, and they're amazing for hip-hop and bass.However, the on the go headphone, the headphone for the NYC subway and the airplane, my baseline audio equipment was lacking in bass and I wanted more. The headphones I've used recently and liked were:Etymotic ER-4P Portable In-Ear Earphonesand after 5 wonderful years, I replaced them withShure SE310 Sound Isolating Earphone - BlackWhich I felt had better bass response and weren't quite as flat.But I wanted more bass, I've gotten more and more into hip-hop and I wanted a frickin subwoofer in my brain (without muddying the mids and treble).So how do the UE SuperFi 5 EB rate with me? As followsThe +- The bass is obscene, as in great, as in beyond expectation from an in ear monitor. Straight up amazing for hip-hop and anything else employing an 808. Just downloaded the new Waka Flocka Flame album? Allow it to blow your mind apart.- The mids and treble actually sound fantastic and balanced in the soundstage due to the fact that there are two drivers. Classical, The Clash and other genres all really pop with these, I was surprised.- Some noise isolation allows for lower level listening, preserving hearing.- The cord detaches from the actual monitor pieces incase the cord gets damaged, easy repair.The -- As opposed to the ER-4p, Shure and other in ear monitors, the little tube that the silicone earpiece slides onto isn't the same. Your old silicone and memory foam tips won't work. UE has a diameter about twice as wide as those other headphones.- Because the diameter of the tube that goes into the ear is so much wider, it doesn't go deep into the ear, but more like stuck into the front bit of the ear canal.- Because of both things above, you're giving up about 16 dB of sound isolation. HOWEVER, this is still pretty good on planes and subways, but its not the chamber of silence that a shure monitor is.- The cord is way short.- There are days when these really hurt my ear after an hour, but for the most part they're okay for use throughout the day. That said, they aren't as comfortable as Etymotics or Shures that you can thoughtlessly wear all day.Conclusion:Do you want fantastic bass (and overall warm sound) in an in-ear monitor that gives just barely enough sound isolation for urban commuting but that might be a bit uncomfortable? GET THESE, DO NOT PASS GO.Do you not care about insane bass and want a warm monitor that blocks all sound and is comfortable all day? Get the Shure 310 (old style, the new style is very uncomfortable)"}

I have to figure out if i lost reception (which has never been the case) or if I hit stop somehow and now I have to hit the same button again to start play.I'll update more if I get any other problems with it.Edit - July 2013So just something for you who do buy it.

{"reviewerID":"A1RV2KSZ8R7MWB","reviewText":"So I live in off-campus housing for school, and my car is usually parked in a parking garage for a better part of the month. The problem with having the little suction cup is that if its still there even with out the GPS, there is a risk of it being stolen (theft is a very common occurrence on a college campus). Then taking it off becomes a hassle, since well A) there is a residue on the windshield and B) the hope that successive reapplications of the suction cup will actually hold after the suction cup has either collected dust or become brittle.The solution? Well this friction mount works really well. At first I though perhaps it would slip off, but the rubber mount and the weight (little bean bag weights) hold it down firm. I don't have to worry about the windshield residue or even taking something off my windshield anymore. All I do is park my car, take off my GPS and take it with me (I never leave it in my car) and then take the mount and stuff it just in front of the passenger's seat. Works perfectly!The only complaints I have is that its a little bulky but often times it is still possible to hide. Also, the constant removal from the dash to the floor does get some dust underneath so you have to brush it off every now and then.All in all, very useful product. As long as you're not making sudden turns (and I mean like practically drifting) then this thing will just stay in place. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to replace that annoying suction cup on the windshield."}

The status\/lan led are blinking and I can't connect to the UI.I have also the patriot javelin s4 (bought on Oct 2011) and I was a little disappointed with javelin (didn't support the current version of the mac os and the firmware update for the itunes compatibility took almost 1 year to be released!. Because of that and because I needed another array I decided give a try on Synology.Of course I had loved all the features and management interface of the synology compared to the javelin.But today I had a huuuuge disappointment. Suddenly my machines couldn't access the synology, when I went to check the array, the status LED was blinking orange, the disks leds were all off, the lan led blinking but no response of the array at all via the network which is the only way to access the management console. So basically it crashed with all my data stuck on that.Righ now I'm on the phone for more than half hour listening over and over \"all of our representatives are currently busy\". With this wait, I had time to take care of lots of things and now I'm writing this review.My javelin still working and believe or not I never had to power off my javelin.Now I'm thinking, it's better to have something reliable like the javelin than have my data lost (at least I consider lost for now because I can't access the data from the synology and waiting for support to fix the issue.Those are the time I wish to be a large corporation as customer, I'm pretty sure if I was one large business company relying to somebody to fix my disk array I would have a response in 5 minutes and have several support managers pampering me 24x7 and lots of engineers working overnight to  fix the issue and recover my data and maybe receiving a free top of line array plus free service on in house installation and configuration. Oh well, when you have money and large business you are on the top. Unfortunately this  doesn't exist on the market of the masses even if the product is kind of expensive like synology.Because of the issue I have in 5 months of use and also because of the wait on the phone I'm giving 1 star to this product. Too bad because I liked the features and UI of the array."}

{"reviewerID":"A1NMUFN5IXY8BT","reviewText":"I upgraded from a Pioneer VSX-515 (no HDMI) and did a lot of research before deciding on this receiver.  AVS Forum was a great help (and I highly, highly recommend Batpig's \"Denon to English\" setup guide).Armed with that guide, the manual made MUCH more sense.Out of the box, the unit sounded good, even before I did any of the Audyssey auto-setup things.  I had to order a microphone stand adapter to properly mount the microphone and perform the setup, but if you own a camera tripod, that should be sufficient.  I was in a hurry and used a small step-stool with the mic sitting on the top step, and it actually surprised me how great a job it did.Even without approaching the setup in an optimal way, the results were noticable.  The system correctly set my speaker distances, and measured the acoustics of my room so well that watching TV and movies is a completely new experience.  My equipment was always good, but it never sounded THIS good.  The receiver compensated for some surround placement issues, warned me of an out-of-phase speaker, and cleaned up my subwoofer so well, I no longer feel like I need to move them elsewhere in the room to get the most out of them.I can't wait till the mic stand adapter arrives so I can spend a little time with this receiver and REALLY run through the auto-setup the right way (I only measured 3 of the available 6 locations, too!).All in all, I'm happy with this purchase.  It's some of the best money I've spent.  I run my PS3 and Dish network HD-PVR through it with no problems, and I previously had a Nintendo Wii connected through the component that had ZERO issues getting to the TV via the single HDMI cable.  So, so nice to have only ONE cable going from the receiver to the TV.If you're on the fence, just go for it.  You won't be disappointed."}

{"reviewerID":"A1RL1OTV8IJMVD","reviewText":"As others have said, this TV is excellent. Forget the marketing talk of 150,000:1 contrast ratio etc. All you need to know is that as of August, 2009, there are very few TVs that beat this set in terms of black level. (local dimming LED LCD TVs, and a few high-end plasmas to be precise, and even then - only just!).I'm going to focus more on what the issues are with this TV, bearing in mind that I think this is an excellent set.1.) Gaming lag. For those that say there isn't any - your standards may not be high enough. With Game Mode set to OFF, Call of Duty, Rock Band, Hot Shots Golf etc are simply unplayable. With Game Mode set to ON, these games are quite playable. How acceptable is very dependent on the person. I have no trouble, personally, with Game Mode ON, but Game Mode off was a nightmare. You lose the benefits of 240hz AMP with Game Mode ON, but this is a VERY acceptable trade-off, and I have no trouble playing games in an essential 60hz mode.2.) Viewing angles. They're NOT very good. At a little less than 10 feet away from my 46\" B750, the left side of my TV washes out if I scoot a little to the right, and the right side washes out if I scoot a little to the left of the TV. This is a definite issue, and is worse than my last year's Samsung LN46A650. At Best Buy etc you will NOT see these defects as the ambient light overpowers any viewing angle discrepancies. At home, in a dimly-lit movie room, or showing darker material, these problems will become more apparent - glaring in fact.3.) Clouding\/flashlighting: This has been an issue for several generations of Samsung LCDs, and 2009 is no exception. Again, this is not something you'll notice in a storefront because the lighting overpowers the problem, but at home, back in that very same dimly-lit room, especially showing darker material, you'll notice the splotches of lighter colored areas on the screen. Some are worse than others. If you never watch TV in a darker environment with dark material, chances are you'll never notice the problem. If your TV was delivered, like most people's sets are, during the day, you will NOT see this issue until night closes in.4.) While the see-through TV stand stalk is very pretty and gives the impression of a \"floating\" TV, it makes hiding the power cable and video\/audio cables impossible, as they are normally hidden by a solid stalk. So yes, very pretty, but non-functional, as you can see the cables trailing down behind the see-through stem. A little annoying!----I know this sounds like doom and gloom, but it really isn't. This is an excellent set. I love mine. Definitely the best CCFL LCD Samsung has put out to date, but still in need of a bit of work on their quality control. I simply won't defend something just because I bought it - this is a great TV, but it does have some problems that Samsung should work hard to overcome."}

{"reviewerID":"AW7OOW21LVQO3","reviewText":"Under normal circumstances, I'd write a much more detailed review, but unfortunately, this TomTom never even made it on it's first trip in my car before the glitches became too much to deal with.This could simply be a glitch with my unit, but when you are using the power cable with the device, the screen brightness will \"blink\" a bit, going from bright to dim, bright to dim, intermittently, with the words \"charging battery\" popping up on the screen every so often.  Even going into the settings menu and telling it not to do this has no effect it seems, as until the battery if fully charged, it will continue to do this, even if trying to use it via the power cable.  VERY annoying when you're trying to see the screen and it adjusts itself in this manner.  Resetting the machine and trying to manually override it again had no effect - until the battery is fully charged, it continued to do it.The second irritation was when in night screen mode, when you tell it you'd prefer day screen view, it will not save the setting if you start a new route.  You have to go back into settings to reset that as well.Last, then built-in mount make the unit nearly impossible to use it with a universal dash mount.  There is no length to it since it's built into the back of the TomTom (it just swivels out), so while it's ok to use on a windshield, if you try to mount it on one of the \"bean bag\" style dash mounts (my preference), it has a hard time sticking to it, and you can't tilt the screen due to the short length of the mount stem.My unit was boxed back up and ready to go back to the store simply for the blinking screen issue.  I don't drive every day.  Lithium-ion batteries lose a tiny bit of charge every day, so that means every day I would go out, I'm going to be dealing with this \"charging battery\" flickering screen until the unit is charged.  Sorry TomTom - that's just too much from a top of the line unit.  Going back for a Garmin."}

{"reviewerID":"A2KBEUB8QIDZDZ","reviewText":"Over the last couple of weeks I have learned a ton about computer sound, encoding, outputs, and sound cards in general.  Unfortunately, this has been because 4 out of the 5 devices I have tried to get Dolby Live 5.1 via optical S\/PDIF (TOSLINK) from have failed miserably.  Please, if you're a gamer trying to get 5.1 in-game through an optical output without spending an insane amount, buy this card.  It supports Dolby Digital Live, which is what is needed to get 5.1 in games.  It has official drivers that can be downloaded and run without any kind of issue.  I know that seems like a given for any sound card but after my last couple of weeks I can tell you that it absolutely is not.EDIT:  Previously I said I was giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 due to some distortion.  Since then I have realized that the problem lay in my headphones rather than the card.  After testing with different surround headphones I can say that the audio works perfectly and boost it back up to 5 stars."}
{"reviewerID":"AATO5M2LPTX9L","reviewText":"First the build of this tripod bag is magnificent. The design and the material are perfect for its purpose, which is to protect a great tool. The reason for my low rating is that for my tripod the Manfrotto 055CXPRO4 with the added head still floats around in the bag. The reason for purchasing this bag is that it is the smallest case available with padding, and length wise the bag is about right, just a few inches of free space. The problem is the width of the bag makes it look somewhat flabby even when I am caring it.Does the bag serve its purpose?, Yes it exceed it!But the look bothers me for the price.( if Manfrotto made smaller bags WITH padding..... that would be great for my tripod needs.)"}

Previously I had one set as the primary, and the other in \"repeater\" mode, but that set-up isn't ideal. This seemed to be a good way to link the two. It works as advertised and has good speeds, but buying two of these at $80+ each and taking the time to set them up is a lot of hassle and expense to do something that an Ethernet cable or Wifi Router set as a repeater can do just as well. I don't hate this, I just recommend that you consider all your options before going down the MoCA path."}
{"reviewerID":"A3SJAEIT6G1NSD","reviewText":"I was looking for an upgrade to my original Roku player and needed it to have the following capabilities, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, and the ability to play files and media stored on my home network. I've been doing some extensive searching and couldn't find any single device that did it all, but this seemed to come pretty close and offered a lot more.So sounds great right? well here's the real deal, while it looks like it has loads of content and channels that other players don't have, most of them are either broken or severely outdated. For instance, i was excited that there was a Vice magazine app, i love watching the vice documentaries online, so i figured i could watch videos right on my tv. Upon opening the app, i was disappointed, the content was old and didn't have a fraction of what was on the actual vice website. I could have opened it on the built in browser, but what's the point if there's an app that's supposed to be easier to navigate and is more intuitive?.There's also other channels like twit tv, that i was unable to stream at the highest quality, video froze and i had to restart the app several times. There's another nature station (i cant recall the name) which all the videos were broken, the vevo app didn't work either, i searched for Chris Brown and it all of his videos appeared when searching but upon playing, it gave an error \"this content is not available, blah blah\". So it boasts tons of apps, a major selling point over other players, but most of them do not work or are outdated. The only satisfactory working apps are the big wigs, Netflix, Spotify, Vudu, AOL, pandora, etc, all work well. So after this, i thought to myself, was the 180 for this worth it when other streaming devices can play these for half the price?. The extra content that would have made this a better deal does not even work properly? Probably not.So i tried to find something else that would justify me keeping this. The only really unique feature not found on other players is the web browser, it supports adobe flash so you can browse to almost any site and play embedded flash videos. This works really well, and the browser speed is pretty good. Navigating kinda sucks though with the remote, as you need to use the up down left right to scroll a mouse pointer. It would be nice to have the directional pad function as a touch sensitive pad as well, but its just a 4 way rocker with a button in the middle. You can connect a mouse and keyboard, but u'd think you can use that in place of the remote, but no, the mouse cursor only appears in the browser and you need to use the remote for everything else. I also couldn't find an official boxee remote app for my android phone in the Google market even though they say there's one.Onto the hardware, which is pretty beefy, Atom Chip, 1GB ram, etc, but i'm not a big fan of the weird looking melting box design. It would be nice to include a stand so it can be placed upright like a regular cube, or have the option to remove it for those who like the funky URBAN melting ice cube position. I'm thinking a clear plastic stand would be nice, maybe on Boxee 2 who knows.Otherwise back to the basics, quality is great streams in 1080p etc, no issues with sound, video or build quality and plays almost everything i threw at it ( even some old TIFF files that i could never open on my pc). I still haven't found out how to zoom on the photo viewer, not sure if you can or not.I had some issues with it freezing, though only twice, not a big deal but if it happens again, i might become a bit worried about it. The bottom line is, the hardware is over 2 years old and while this would have been a smash hit when it was released in 2010, cheaper players like the Roku 2 are and the WD TV Live streaming are catching up. It would have been a better deal if this player was in the 120-140 range but i don't think it offers enough unique features to justify the 180 dollar price tag. I'm going to return mine and get the WD HD TV live which offers the same features plus network streaming, i loose web browsing and social networking capabilities but hey i wouldn't want it broadcasting that i'm watching those late night movies (if you know what i mean) to all my friends anyway.-Pros* Strong Hardware under the covers (Should be good for the next 3-4 years)* Plays everything i could throw at it* More of a software platform than a media player, open to enhancements, upgrades, third party developers.* Web Browser* Youtube ( Which Roku at the moment does not offer )-Cons* Freezes at times* Some channels are broken and outdated* Expensive ( Compared to other models )* No Hulu"}

{"reviewerID":"A2RS66Y79Q8X0W","reviewText":"I love the Manfrotto monopod. I highly recommend using it for videography and cinematography. It's steady, mobile, and compact. The monopod comes with a fluid head and the base legs are equipped with a fluid pan and ball pivoting joint. This allows for smooth pans, dips, and tilts or any combination there of. It's compact desing allows the user greater mobility while still maintaining a steady shot. This is great if you are filming dancing or a subject prep in tight quarters. You can move from angle to angle and get great steady shots. The telescoping leg is easy and quick to set up and extends from 30 to 80 inches (or undder 3ft to 6.5ft).This product is stable and reliable. One thing I suggest is always have a can of WD-40 near by because the base ball joint can feel a little sticky if it gets dirty. I lubricate the ball joint before every use and it works perfectly.I highly recommend this product to live event videographers and cinematographers."}

This one works wonderfully and has not shown any issues thus far.I cannot say it is under powered, because we add up the power needs of each item it powers and make sure there is room to spare. It works much the same way a car does, you can run it in the red all the time, but you'll probably burn it out much faster than if you ran it under the max it can be pushed to. This powers a standard desktop machine for us and has worked quite well so far. We play some games on this machine, but it is generally used for a music player in the living room and for company to access the internet or play multi-player games with us on. Not a huge power need, but so far so good. Would recommend and use again."}

When you hold this case in your hand it feels substantially thicker than previous iterations.

My only complaint is that they didn't drill one more set of holes in the straps for a little tighter grip. This was easily fixed with a leather awl at home.I will say that my Gladius came without the internal doors to keep the leather ends from rubbing on your iPad. I don't know if this was a last minute change after the manual was printed or an unfortunate omission during packaging.

The stand is plastic also, and with it attached your iPad and screen protector are fully covered.  I am not crazy about the stand; I could not get it to work properly.

The keyboard is detachable and can be used as a standalone unit. It will make a great thumb-type keyboard if only it were half to one inch narrower.

{"reviewerID":"A2FIC05DY3HT7J","reviewText":"I read about this, and waited for it to be out for a couple of months to see what others were saying about it.  Finally, after it had been out for a couple of months, and I read many reviews, I decided to buy one.  For $35, I felt it would be a decent gamble if it worked, and little lost if it didn't.It arrived when I expected it to, and setup took only about five minutes, with much of the time required to get the device out of the box and physically connect it to my television, and power it up.  As a Netflix subscriber, I wanted a means to watch videos on my television in the bedroom, and this worked great.  It takes only seconds to switch the video from my iphone to the chromcast, and the controls remain on my iphone.  We have also used a tablet running android to play vidoes through this, and that works well also.  Basically, if you can turn on a computer and connect it to a wireless network, you can handle this device.  We have watched many movies with this, and some television shows off of Netflix, and we have had no issues with connectivity with the device during playback.  I have a wireless N router, and highspeed cable broadband (10 - 20 MBS).  Once you start the streaming to the device, you can turn off your device, as the streaming will continue straight from the wifi to the Chromecast Player.I am only giving this four stars, as I feel it should do more, as, right now it is limited to Netflix, Google Play, and a few others that I don't use.  I hope to see the apps to increase in the future, however, this is cheaper than a Roku device, and accomplishes what it says it will do.I expect significant improvements on this device over the next few months, possibly a next generation out within six months.  But, for less than the price of movie tickets for a family of four, and if you need a means of streaming videos to your television set, this is a great device.

Regardless, I can't quibble with the price and overall performance has been quite good.As for comfort, I've forgotten it's on my head more than once, so it's definitely not uncomfortable despite the earpiece cushion being fairly small and resting on top of my ear.  Granted, I'm accustomed to wearing a headset for long periods due to my job, so YMMV.  As a personal preference, I removed a foam earpiece circle\/cover from another headset and placed it around the existing earpiece pad on this unit.  The earpiece cushion on this unit is covered in vinyl... not uncomfortable at all, I just prefer feeling foam on my ear.Volume is spot on perfect combined with my Panasonic phones at home.  Some have said the volume is too low with other phones... unfortunately I don't have an alternate phone set to test against.I guess the best vote of confidence one can give in retail is to buy something more than once.  I am buying another one just to have a backup!"}

{"reviewerID":"A35DZ2414ZIFSQ","reviewText":"I use a Nikon DSLR and wanted an inexpensive pocket camera to complement it.  Nikon seems less popular than Canon in the P&S; market and it's easy to find this camera with a healthy discount.The camera features a huge LCD, a fast start-up time, very intuitive controls and menus, optical vibration reduction (VR), and high light sensitivity (ISO).  The last two features in particular set it apart from earlier Nikon models like the S1, which could not take a clean picture without the flash anywhere short of a professionally-lit studio.  Of course, the picture gets grainy fast if you use the higher ISO settings.The camera does have several faults mentioned by other reviewers: the response time is terrible, especially if you do not partially press the shutter button to pre-meter and focus.  The power button is too easy to hit accidentally.  It is easy to cover the lens with a finger because of the lens's location.All in all, I would recommend this a good, inexpensive pocket camera for anyone EXCEPT for those who mainly take candid action snapshots of their kids or friends.  Those users should look for a faster camera."}

{"reviewerID":"A13O50D40K6XX1","reviewText":"The XP510 is my 3rd headset. The first two are the logitech g35, and then the Triton 720+. I do like my first two and have no real complaints about them. The XP510 is nicer.I really like the abundant features, especially the bluetooth capabilities built in. I've taken several phone calls using these, and it's very convenient especially if you're in game with the volume blasting your ear drums. I don't have to worry about missing an important call.I also really like the comfort. This headset has the best feel when it's on my head. The cups are soft and the pressure from the band that holds the cups is not to tight. It stays on my head without any buildup to pain.I have had static a bit, right out of the doors. It has however gone away. I hope it doesn't come back, and I certainly will post an update if it happens.  This static was out of the box on my first use without charging the headset.I did have a little trouble getting setup. I did not at first realize I needed an additional cord to be able to chat on the PS4 which is the primary system i planned to use this headset for. I do own all the other current and last gen consoles and may switch between however.to repeat:YOU WILL NEED TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL CORD TO USE THIS HEADSET TO CHAT ON THE PLAYSTATION 4.I'm not sure if that was listed in the product description. All i saw was compatible and felt good about thatI didn't really talk about the audio yet, so here goes.The sound\/music is amazing. There is a good amount of bass in this headset as well. The first thing I did when i got it going was listen to some music. Played Metallica, then some ELO, and some other random music; yes I have a diverse interest. The point is that it all sounded great. I could easily see myself listening to music on this headset if i ever needed to.Overall if you have the money to put down on this expensive hardware, I would recommend picking the xp510 up. It sounds great, feels good on your head, and offers more features than you'll likely use.There is a lot more that I didn't cover as I have not gotten to it. yeah, it's got a lot going on."}

I attached my Sony Soundbar to my  46&#34; wall mounted flat screen mount in minutes without any problems. The instructions were super easy to follow and the mount makes the TV\/Soundbar  combination look like a fluid unit without any nasty gaps.The best part for me is there are no more hanging wires which are not aesthetically pleasing to look at. Clearly this is another example of a good solution to a less than attractive problem."}
{"reviewerID":"ATDW9KG6KN2D5","reviewText":"I just started using this remote this morning, but so far it's working exactly how I want it to work.  I had to install 3rd party software to get it to control anything other than media center, but I found a free program that works really well -- I would have given this remote 5 stars if it had come with the ability to control other programs.It installed itself automatically in just a few seconds (windows vista home premium 64bit OS).  The signal strength is great - the receiver seems more than sensitive enough.As is, the remote is only set up to work for windows media center.  The directional arrows have some functionality in windows, but it's not enough to control anything. The remote doesn't give you any control over any of the individual buttons, which is annoying.  It doesn't even include a button to exit media center once you're in it - you can put the pc in standby, and you can turn the monitor off\/on, but you can't exit media center.  I guess this makes sense, considering they apparently don't think this remote will be used in any other application.However, this was easy enough to fix this with 3rd party software. I'm currently running a program called EventGhost, which has allowed me to set up the remote to control other programs, as well as other options (such as exiting media center).  It took a little while for me to figure out how to use it, but now it all makes sense.  Once I got the 3rd party software all figured out, the remote became exactly what I want in a PC remote.The design of the remote seems fine to me.  No backlighting, but not such a big deal to me.  I also set up my harmony 670 universal remote without much trouble.  The only issue I had was finding the manufacturer in the harmony remote software (although this is a problem with the harmony software, not this media center remote) -- MediaGate is what it says on the remote and in the description on amazon, but my logitech harmony software didn't have mediagate in the list of manufacturers.  I went through the wizard for a manufacturer not listed, and it came up with \"AL Tech GP-IR01BK\", which appears to be correct (at least all the correct functions were listed).  Also, newegg's description of the exact same remote indicates it is made by a company called \"AVS Gear.\"  Anyway, once I got the harmony program to find the correct remote, everything from that point on was easy.Anyway -- so far so good!  I'll modify my review if it suddenly stops working.  I'm planning on upgrading to windows 7 in the next few weeks, so hopefully it still works after that."}

It's pretty rare that I listen to that much in a day so I can't say I've really put the battery to the test yet.As a portable amp this is very capable of driving mySennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise-Canceling Headphoneswith the gain set to 6db when connected to my old Apple iPhone 3G using the L3 line out cable. When docked to my FiiO E09K and connected to my MacBook Pro via USB it has no problem syncing at 24\/96 (maximum bit rate via USB) and Mac OS remembers its volume settings and switches automatically to the FiiO when it is connected.The only little quirk I've found is the sleep timer isn't really what you think it is. I thought it was a setting to tell it to power down automatically after a period of inactivity. Instead you set it to say, 60 minutes and it turns off after the time has elapsed. I guess it is useful if you are listening to music in bed?When it comes down to it, you can't really beat this thing for the number of features it has (portable amp, USB sound card, etc) for the price. Highly recommended."}

{"reviewerID":"AOVROBZ8BNTP7","reviewText":"What I like about the 64G:-I can fill it with HD videos and music, slip it into my pocket and stream to a phone or tablet when I don't have access to the internet.-Because my kids have tablets, I can put content on the drive, which they can play back in the car or a doctor's waiting room.-Can stream different media to different devices at the same time (I've tested two at the same time with 720p).-The Media Drive battery lasts at least 6 hours. Can probably go longer but I haven't tried.What I don't like about the 64G:-The playback device must have the Media Drive app installed in order to stream media.-I can't access the drive using apps other than the Media Drive app. That means, for instance, no PowerAmp.-It takes a very, very long time to transfer files from a PC to the Media Drive (via USB).-Can't wirelessly transfer files from a PC to the Media Drive.Verdict: It's good for devices with limited storage. It's good for allowing multiple devices to access a single source of media. However, I don't use it often because it's easier for me to just put the media files right on my device. If you, have a device with 16 GB or more of storage and don't fancy sharing your media, then just put the content right on your phone or tablet and cut out the middleman (or media drive)."}

{"reviewerID":"AOA0XDHSL5GRY","reviewText":"I purchased this for my 1988.5 Suzuki Samurai, mainly to add Ipod support.Installing it in a Samurai requires a little persuasion, but it will fit using the stock brackets with no cutting or other modifications.I first used the 21 year old stock 4-5\/8\" \"1-way\" speakers, and it was a decent improvement over the stock deck, but I knew that a speaker upgrade would really add to the experience.I then hooked up a set of Pyle PL42BL 4-Inch 180 Watt Two-Way Speakers and found the total lack of bass to be annoying.  I had relied on resources which said that the stock speakers were 4\", which was incorrect.  The 4\" speakers mounted to the factory grilles though, but the right 5.25\" speaker would as well, and would have much better sound.  I was also unable to hear the radio at freeway speeds which was unacceptable.  I feel this is due to using higher power speakers thanThe stock speaker setup in a Samurai has the 4-5\/8\" speakers mounted to the grills using 5.25\" mounts, and the grills then mount to 6.5\" mounts.  This means that a 6.5\" speaker can be mounted with no cutting, though the stock grils may not work.So I then bought a set of Pioneer TS-A1673R 6.5-Inch 3-way speakers.  After installing these, I was wowed by the sound from this 2-speaker set-up.  It is actually better than the sound in many 4-speaker cars, and the way the Samurai directs the sound, it sounds great even from the back seat.  I now have no plans for installing rear speakers.I am extremely pleased with the Pioneer deck and speakers.  Whatever speakers you wind up with, if you are not using an amp, try to stay close to 25 watts RMS, which is the output of the deck.  The Pioneers I used are 35 watts RMS, which seems to be a good match as I can here the speakers no matter how fast I am going.It integrates seamlessly with an Ipod, and also plays MP3s off of a USB drive.  The tuner has very good sensitivity.  I do wish the display were bigger and the controls on the deck easier to use, but for $115, I really can't complain."}

{"reviewerID":"A3KKM0T1KY42HA","reviewText":"My Netgear Router sent a Wi-Fi signal that basically provided coverage to the room it was in, the immediate adjacent two rooms, and two rooms directly above the room that the router was in, leaving about  of my house without a signal. I called the cable company and I was prepared to pay them to provide a solution that gave my entire house Wi-Fi. The cable company (Optimum) said they don't do that, \"All they provide is an Internet connection and a Wi-Fi router.\" They were nice enough and offered me an \"upgraded\" router free of change with my service; they claimed that their Sagemcom Router would give better range than my Netgear, but ultimately it provided the same exact range (and perhaps a bit less).So I was speaking to a friend who said he had a local high end audio\/visual company come in that installed a Wi-Fi antenna in his attic that gave the entire house Wi-Fi, but he spent $1000 to do it! For that price I told my kids that they're just gonna have to go to the rooms with Wi-Fi if they want Wi-Fi. But that solution wasn't practical because the kids would more often than not just use their cellular data instead of moving to the room with Wi-Fi, and that, friends and neighbors, can end up costing more than a lease for a Cadillac if they go over their wireless data limit on a regular basis. Yes, I know you can have the cellular company shut their data down when it gets to a certain limit, but that would make for less than harmonious relations around the house.So I called the cable company one more time and asked if there were any alternatives to a $1000 solution, and the guy on the phone gasped. He said, \"$1000?!? Just go to an electronics store and get a range expander for $50 or less.\" Well, color me nave, but where has this TP-LINK TL-WA850RE 300Mbps Universal Wi-Fi Range Extender been all my life?!  (And why didn't they tell me that last time?)The TP-LINK arrived from Amazon, and within 15 minutes of accepting the package from UPS, almost my entire house now has Wi-Fi. Out of the box, FIRST you just plug the thing in in the same room as your router. Wait for the LED display on the front of the TP-LINK to indicate that it is receiving a wireless signal, then just hold the WPS button on your router down for 5 seconds, then within a minute or two press the WPS button on the TP link, and voil&agrave;! Once connected, SECOND, move it to the room farthest away from the router that still gets a decent signal from the router; for me it was upstairs in one of the rooms caddy corner to the room with the router below; the result was a rebroadcast of Wi-Fi service to the entire house! Just be sure that the room that you relocate the TP-LINK to shows AT LEAST 3 bars of signal strength. MY TP-LINK is receiving 3 bars of signal strength but interestingly it is broadcasting 5 bars of strength according to most of the devices connected to it.There's no need select a different W-Fi network on any of your devices or re-enter a Wi-Fi passkey; as long as the device you're connecting was already connected to your original router, the device will simply find the re-broadcast signal from the TP-LINK and automatically connect.So try this inexpensive option before you pay some outrageous price for a custom Wi-Fi service install."}

My Stylus 850SW has had a disappointing battery life compared to some other cameras I have had.

Example, yesterday my wife fully charged the camera and took about 30 pictures before this 1100 mAh started to die.Overall: 4 out of 5 stars.

The last one I used had adhesive on the screen, which I didn't like, and left bubbles not matter how careful I was in the the application. I LOVE this one because it only adheres to the border. Surprisingly, this is enough to attach it securely to my iPad Mini. I LOVE the tactile feel and actually prefer it to the original screen surface. Works well with my stylus, however I do need to apply a little more pressure when handwriting or drawing. The installation was easy and quick. I like that you can easily remove and attach it again. It seems to fit well even with the back cover I have on my iPad Mini. Now I have all over protection with little added weight to my svelte iPad Mini. It does seem a little more costly than other screen protectors, currently, on the market but I think it's well worth the difference considering what you're getting. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a quality screen protector with ease of installation and no bubbles!Update: After using this for a while I noticed another \"positive\". This screen protector doesn't seem to smudge and leave fingerprint marks like the original screen. I was constantly cleaning the original screen with a micro fiber cloth and sometimes with a very moist (water only) cloth to remove smudges and fingerprints.

{"reviewerID":"A3JR6D5B9WF5J8","reviewText":"First off, the technical specs for signal and streaming are excellent. However, since I didn't need to upgrade my old router for that, my purchase was based on a different need. I have been searching for a router with great parental access controls for a while and this was recommended to me. The Live Parental Controls (LPC) listed on Netgear's site as most customizable sounded like what I wanted, as did the access control schedule, so I figured worth the high cost.What a let down. It is very limited, and I hate to think what the non custom options are. In fact, I dragged out the basement an old 2006 basic linksys (2006!) for comparison and the 8 year old model had better options for access control.What it can do;- LPC lets you set limits on internet  use and the kind of sites. Low settings just restrict porn and phishing sites, all the way up to High that restricts social media. You can set a schedule so after certain hours the restrictions change- Access control lets you block certain IPs- Scheduler lets you block service during certain time periodsLimitations:- To get around LPC limits, say, parents want to use social media, parents would need to access via the Genie installed on their computer with a bypass account, and only if you are on a PC. You couldn't do it from your tablet, for example.- Service blocking is by IP, not by the device's MAC address. It doesn't even offer IP address for the iPods that connected to it, so I had no ability to limit them by this method.- Scheduling only allows ONE schedule option, and adding any service blocks by schedule all must adhere to this schedule. So if you have young kids that you want limited to an hour a day, and teens that are allowed more access, tough. No can do.I recognize that for many people, parental controls aren't an issue, but if you have a teen or younger in the house, simple, effective & flexible controls are wanted by many parents who are frustrated by the industries gap in this market. Yes, we can & do say 'no' to our kids. But we're also not trying to be sitting on their shoulders allowing zero privacy or freedoms at all. Great controls allow flexibility along with safety.Since writing this, I did find more suitable options though none perfect. I believe the company who gets this right & markets well will have a field day with sales."}

However, it appears that many of the settings you can use to modify the finer points of the package are done through a web browser (good) that must be running Java 6 (bad).This is bad because Apple does not support Java much at all, and certainly not Java 6.  Old versions of Java have a security problem that made my company's IT department abandon it completely.  So...I can try to figure out how\/where to find an old, buggy version of Java to load on my Mac at home, or violate the security standards of my employer and load an old version of Java on my PC at work if I can find it.  Forget about making settings on a phone, iPad or Chromebook.Some day, companies who really &#34;get&#34; consumer electronics (Apple, Nest) will come up with a webcam that hosts and archives images elegantly and simply.

I am a southpaw, so I'm not sure if this matters, but naturally my hand wants to rest so that the most comfortable buttons are the upper left and lower right.  I simply cannot get comfortable using the trackball otherwise.  I find it difficult in particular to hit the upper right button, which makes it functionally useless, and the lower left button is only slightly less useless. The ball also sits too tall. I've stopped using this trackball because it has caused pain in my upper arm.The Kensington Powerball had nearly all of the flexibility of the slimblade trackball in a much better ergonomic fashion. It's big problem was an easily gunked interior, but this could've been easily resolved with an optical mouse. (Alas, its driver doesn't work with Vista and beyond, either).  The Kensington Powerball remains the best trackball ever... nice ergonomic feel and very flexible.  If I were right handed I think the Logitech Trackman would be a good choice, although it could use some extra buttons.I've been really disappointed with Kensington's trackballs of late.  This Slimblade is nicely constructed but ergonomically terrible.  The Orbit trackball with scroll ring is ergonomically terrible and feels cheaply constructed.Also, if you're looking for chording (programming two buttons hit at once), Kensington told me that my firmware version didn't support it, but newer ones do.

I don't have stuck in my tablet's case but it's always with me ready to go."}
{"reviewerID":"A7MX3M6ZFKNYC","reviewText":"For its price and size, this camera is an excellent choice. This is not the best Canon camera--it is not a 7D for example. The size of blow-ups and severity of cropping will determine how many MP are needed.  Fifteen megapixels are more than enough for decent sized blow-ups. The T1i is a lot smaller and lighter than the 7D, which was important for me because I planned to take it while backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas. In deciding which camera to buy, I finally realized that now digital DSLRs are really light-capturing computers, and we should purchase the camera with some of the same expectations that we have when buying computers: we don't plan to use them for a decade, but instead expect to upgrade.  So the price (less than half that of a 7D) was a big factor. The money not spent on the body can then go into lenses.I have had no problems with the camera so far (1700 exposures). Folks having experience with Canon DSLRs (I was upgrading from the 300D) will have no trouble navigating the buttons and selections. The large screen and screen resolution are good features.  The smaller physical size is not a problem for folks with large hands (as mine are).This comes with Canon Digital Professional software.  This software allows cropping, rotating, level adjustment, white balance adjustment, etc. of the RAW files. As far as I can see, the software allows application of all of the menu choices that one might make in the camera if one were saving images as JPEG files.  I have found that I don't actually need to go to Photoshop unless I am doing \"special effects\" as long as I work with RAW files.  Also, I find that printing from the Canon software produces prints on Canon printers that very closely match what I see on my iMac screen.  The RAW format for this camera is CR2, which was not supported by my version of Adobe Photoshop.  I did upgrade my Adobe software (unanticipated additional expense), but it is possible from the Canon software to write a JPEG file (\"Convert and Save\" from the \"File\" menu) that can be handled with the older versions of Photoshop.When upgrading the camera, I decided to upgrade my photo habits by recording all photos as RAW (CR2) files.  This of course means upgrading storage capacity--I could only fit 200 images on a DVD-R.  This meant that I had to buy a 650 GB external hard drive."}
{"reviewerID":"A2S5VQZJP7PCRY","reviewText":"A friend had one of these and I thought that it would be just the thing - so bought it a few years ago.  I sometimes give power-point presentations or run video from my computer for various events.  This screen is great since it easily packs up and fits in the trunk  of my car - something a traditional movie screen does not!  The setup and break-down is also very quick.  I have used it for small groups up to around 100.  A few times, it would have been nice to raise the stand up a little higher, but I have not found an extension - though have considered building a riser to put under the tripod.  There is also a little warp in the screen in the middle that I notice when setting up or taking it down, but it does not seem to interfere with the image.  When closing it up, you also have to be careful to align with the tracks to properly close it - this isn't a problem for me, but sometimes when someone else helps, they don't pay attention - it still closes, but doesn't create as good of a dust a seal. It also takes relatively little storage space at home.  Again, I am very happy with this screen and would recommend it to anyone that needs a really portable screen."}

{"reviewerID":"A2XJ8B1785HBAZ","reviewText":"I've been using one of these enclosures for a few months now, mostly on the road.  At first I would have given the enclosure 5 stars but recently I've been finding my USB cable working it's way out of the port a little too easily.  The USB 3.0 port is quite shallow, so that it if the connector is twisted left\/right (assuming the port is horizontal) it will lose connectivity.  At first the connection was quite tight so this was rare, but over time the USB jack has become very loose and even the slightest pressure can cause it to lose the connection.  In my case the stability of the connection is quite important, the enclosed drive holds photos and videos taken on the road.  While working on airplanes or other spots where there is limited space and a fairly decent chance the drive will need to be moved around a bit, this enclosure isn't ideal.  A disconnect while writing a video, photo, or library file can easily corrupt it (and indeed it was losing a library file that finally prompted me to write this review).  My solution has been to switch to a longer and much more flexible cable so that moving my Macbook around a bit (e.g when the person in front decides to recline and sleep) I don't lose the drive.  That didn't work for me recently, so I'm probably going to Loctite a short USB 3.0 cable to the back of the enclosure."}

{"reviewerID":"A25K6I70BEHL1W","reviewText":"To be honest, all cases are quite expensive for what they do, and most look just plain bad. This is a rather inexpensive and decent to look at case. I am tempted to give it 4 stars, but really cannot, just on the base of the price. The fact is that this case, and probably 99% of all the rest, just work against what makes the Kindle great: being super thin and compact. Putting your kindle in this will triple the width of the thing in your hand. Yes, I do realize that this is somewhat needed to protect the device, but even with this padding I do not feel like the screen is quite protected as I would want it. So if scratches to the screen are my main concern, having to disregard pressure points that might crack the screen due to the impracticality of the protection, then I can do with 1\/3 of the padding on this thing. Also, when closed, this pouch is quite tight around the edges. It will probably smooth out over time, but right now closing the zipper is not as immediate as it should.I think that if you really must throw your kindle in your stowaway luggage, then yes, this should do an ok job at protecting it. Why you would do so, I cannot guess. While possibly counterintuitive, a rigid cover, with only say 1mm or less of inside padding, will probably do a better job at keeping the device protected and not making the slim Kindle 3 bulky. I have yet to see any of this kind."}
{"reviewerID":"A107QETABJUPYM","reviewText":"The sound is good with clear high and lows but they don't come with any adjustments for different sized ears and the design doesn't keep it secure in them when I'm active.  They may fall out as they have with me.  For me its typically when I'm running but sometimes with just being active they loosen up.  Just might be my ears but it's what I've experienced.  With the price I'm not regretting purchasing them, but will have to get something else for being active.  I did notice the cord is a little heavy compared to the original earphones that came with my MP3.  It's longer and thicker which may help with better sound and help if I wear my MP3 on a belt clip but may also lead to them loosening up while I'm wearing them as well."}

{"reviewerID":"A1QK3OSZ5EIX38","reviewText":"I purchased this camera primarily to use on a family vacation to the Caribbean.  Mostly, I was looking for an relatively inexpensive camera with underwater picture capability that was also compact, for use when I didn't want to carry around my DSLR.  The Kodak C123 Sport seemed to fit the bill.The camera uses an SD memory card (1 1\/4\" X 7\/8\" with a corner that appears dog-eared), and I would recommend at least a couple gigs because of the camera's 12 megapix.**This camera doesn't have a rechargable battery; 2 AA batteries are needed and if you intend to keep the camera ready for spontaneous pictures, make sure you have backups because standard batteries (as opposed to rechargable AA batteries) don't last terribly long. I was disappointed to have to swim back to shore for fresh batteries on two different occasions.  I would guesstimate that a set of batteries lasts maybe 2 or 3 hours.Another consideration for underwater photography- when you turn the camera off and then turn it back on, the camera automatically defaults back to factory settings.  This means that if you have the camera set for underwater photographs and then turn the camera off, when you turn it back on you will have to go to the menu and select underwater photography and then choose either picture or video before taking pictures.  I haven't been able to figure out a way to change the default, but the quality of the photograph(s) improves when the underwater setting is used underwater (I suppose it compensates for the way water refracts light).  On a similar note, pictures that are taken within 30 to 45 minutes of getting out of the water may turn out a bit fuzzy.**On the other hand, this camera is compact, fairly easy to use and takes very clear photographs and videos both in and out of the water.  Occasionally my snorkel mask would fog up, making it difficult to see the camera display.  But in clear water on a sunny day, the pictures came out beautifully.  I (accidentally) took a couple of very short underwater videos when I couldn't clearly see the camera display to see that I selected video over picture, but those videos came out beautifully as well.The floaty armband is also handy, adjustable and serves its purpose well.I cannot comment on the Kodak Share program that comes with the camera, as I haven't had any interest in using it thus far.Anyone considering this camera that would like to see a few examples of underwater pictures can contact me at CBauman@hotmail.com.  Put Kodak Sport C123 in the subject line so I know it's not spam.  I usually check that email address about once or twice a week."}

{"reviewerID":"A2HXE29CU1I24Y","reviewText":"This product has been with me for years. I have the revision 3 and I believe they are up to revision 5 already. It has worked flawlessly with my old Sony Ericsson T610 phone. And it works even better with my current Nokia 6600 mobile.I installed the product in my Apple PowerBook G4 and iBook Dual USB and it instantly recognized the product without any drivers. I also believe this is the same product found inside every Bluetooth-equipped Mac because Apple did release a firmware update to their internal Bluetooth and it included these external D-Link DBT-120 units, if a user had one. (The only problem is that if you updated the firmware that Apple provided, you will not be able to use the D-Link on a PC. I haven't updated mine and never ran into sync problems).I sync my address book and calendar in Jaguar and Panther OS to my mobile phone and iPod without any hitches.Pros:1. Small, compact, light2. No drivers needed for Mac OS Jaguar and Panther and Windows XP OS.3. Price. This product used to cost a lot. Now it has dropped down to USD40. Which is great, because this very same product that is installed internally in Macs still cost USD45 for the option. Shouldn't an OEM product installed during production be cheaper? Furthermore, if it's installed internally then you cannot transfer it between computers. The external is cheaper and transferrable.Cons:1. The only difficulty I can think of is the implementation of the Bluetooth standard across products.I love gadgets and find myself tinkering with anything technological so I usually don't have problems making one product operate with another.The problem with Bluetooth is that there is no standard way to activate and access operation between products. Each product has its own graphic user interface to contend with. Bluetooth is being billed to consumers as an easy plug and play product. I'm sure it is - just not right now as manufacturers are still fiddling with how to integrate it with their products. Hence, other consumers will have to read the manual on how to access and use Bluetooth across products. In products that come with no manual, they will have to be used to fiddling the interface. Until then, I can't wait for the time where Bluetooth actually performs the way it is billed.If it doesn't work the first time, try to understand the logic behind each product's interface. The problem is that if they can't get it to work, they blame D-Link. If you're computer recognizes the product upon install, then there is no problem. If it doesn't and the activity lights don't work, then send it back. Unlike Wireless\/Wired Ethernet products, the user interface is not embedded in the Bluetooth unit. This Bluetooth product is only a vessel. The actual operation is dependent on the computer and interface it has been programmed to interact with Bluetooth."}

I used the native amp in a Sony DVD\/CD player and then again adding a Yamaha Natural Sound pre-amp.  There was a slight improvement with the Yamaha.What initially bothered me was a loudness in the frequencies 125, 250 and 500 cycles (I played with the EQ doing some subtractions in those ranges).  I am not a pro, so you'll have to take this from the perspective of an audio enthusiast.I did lots of A\/B comparisons with the Sony's and the Sennheiser's and came back deciding the Sony's are actually more on the harsh side sonically.  They're very flat, maybe too flat.The Sennheisers are what I think are going to be great for longer listening periods with less ear fatigue - both in music reproduction and sheer comfort in how they fit.  I'm looking forward to more time with them.In the end of my short test, I thought I liked the somewhat tighter, less boomy bass of the Sony's and the upper mid's to high ranges of the Sennheiser's.  The HD-595's are really musical and the Sony's are more hard-line and technical.  These differences are fairly subtle, but I think worth mentioning."}

{"reviewerID":"A18YMFFJW974QS","reviewText":"When buying bookshelf speakers for my surround system my wife had one requirement. They had to be white - I however had a few more criteria.1 - Sound - Always the number 1 priority for speakers. The JBL Northridge are more than adequate. They will not shake the roof, but they do are a solid job as primary speakers and a great job for use a background speaker. As expected, they suffer on the lower end of the frequency scale and really are not effective below about 70hz (my guess). Midrange performance is solid - never muffled - and you are treated with crisp high notes as high as your ears will alloy you to hear!2- Durability - I have had the speakers for about 4 years with no problems. I like the fact that they are a hard-shell plastic as it makes them a little tougher than the old wood encased speakers.3- Works well outdoors - mind you I would not leave these things directly exposed to a downpour, but they should be ok if exposed to some humidity.4- Weight - a little on the heavy side - not bad - certainly not as bad as my big honking floorspeakers, but they weigh about 10lbs a piece. This means it is a bit of a chore if are continuously moving these things from indoors to out. It also means that you need to be careful if you decided to mount them to your walls - you will definitely need to either hit a stud or use screw anchors.Final Verdict - A nice value for the price - the offer good (but not great) sound and can be used indoors and out!4 Stars"}

I'm happy with how it functions, the way it looks and its battery life.  I would definitely recommend this for those who want something small and lightweight while they exercise.The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was due to the crummy software that crashes every time on my Windows 7 machine and the very scatchable screen.  I didn't even have the thing a day before putting an accidental small scratch from my fingernail on the screen.  Since then, it's been marked up a bit more from various use and I've only had it three months.

I actually didn't know that there are other models for this but the thought has crossed my mind since there are a lot of people curious about using this on an SLR and camcorder.I didn't have any problems on it's funtion and performance. Yes, it is a bit heavier and bulky than an actual hiking pole.I do advise to anyone using any bigger type of cams to check their website and see their info and video so you know what to get. Gadgets like this requires further investigatiion on how well it will perform for your cheap to expensive item(s).Lastly for people that gave a one star...maybe you should wait for a hiking pole\/shovel\/axe\/tv antenna\/dousing rod\/tripod combo with a bubble level and hope that would satisfy your needs."}

{"reviewerID":"A2BD4FGMTL0GYV","reviewText":"I was initially impressed with the speaker at the price I paid for it.  I wasn't expecting much but the idea of a multi-input speaker was too much to pass up on.  Sadly, I wish the speaker had managed to last longer than a few hours.The bluetooth feature paired up easily with all my devices and I was listening to music in no time.  Unfortunately, that only lasted a few hours.  The next time I attempted to connect to the device, I realized the speaker was off.  Considering I didn't switch it off myself, I assumed there must have been an auto-off switch built-in.  That wasn't the case as I spent the next hour trying to switch the device on and pair it up only to have it shut off again after about 20 seconds, at most.  I can only guess as to whether it was the battery or an internal part that failed but needless to say, there went that.Luckily, Amazon was pretty easy to work with.  They gave me an RA number and shipping label.  The speaker is heading back to them and I should be getting a refund within a few days with any luck.The moral of this story, you get what you paid for.  Next time, I'll spend a few more dollars and hopefully that'll translate into a better quality product."}

{"reviewerID":"A244CRJ2QSVLZ4","reviewText":"Unable to live without my Apple iPhone 4, it travels with me everywhere I go.  I listen to a lot of music that I have downloaded from the iTunes Store.  I also work two jobs.  Consequently, I sometimes forget to charge my iPhone at night.  I don't realize this until I'm leaving for work and I turn on my iPhone in the car to listen to my favorite songs and the battery is nearly drained.  It is nice to have the Energizer Instant Charger.  I can easily carry it inside my Case Logic CPL-108GY Backpack (Case Logic CPL-108GY Backpack for DSLR Camera and iPad, Gray), which is my constant traveling companion whenever I go to work, church, the mall, etc.The Energizer Charger arrived with three Energizer Ultimate Lithium Batteries already installed.  For the purpose of this review, I removed and reinstalled the batteries; I accomplished this with relative ease.  Compared to standard alkaline batteries, these lithium batteries are far more superior and are reputed to remain charged an extremely long time.  I wouldn't worry about ever finding the Energizer Charger incapacitated when needing it in an emergency, such as being stranded in the middle of a desert and discovering your iPhone is dead.  Furthermore, a plastic cap protects the integrated connector from damage.Currently, the case that protects my iPhone is the Speck CandyShell View Phone Case, (Speck CandyShell View Phone Case for iPhone 4, Fits Verizon and AT&T; Models - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Batwing Black), which is an extremely thick, bulky case.  In order to insert the integrated charging connector into my iPhone's 30-pin dock connector, I must either remove the case, which is nearly impossible, or use an iPhone\/iPod 30-Pin Male to Female White Extender Cable (Charge and Audio Extension Cable for Cars and Speaker Docks Fits Apple iPod \/ iPhone-White 4 Feet).  I use this extender cable for connecting my iPhone to all my docking stations, my favorite one being the XtremeMac IPU-SAS-11 Portable Stereo Speaker with Dock for iPod, iPhone and iPad (Xtrememac IPU-SAS-11 Portable Stereo Speaker with Dock for iPod, iPhone and iPad).If you own an Apple iPhone 4, and you are planning to keep it for a long time, then the Energizer Instant Charger is great to own.  However, if you are like me and you plan to upgrade to an iPhone 5 or iPhone 6, when it is eventually released on the market, then I wouldn't purchase it.  The connector for the iPhone 5 is not a 30-pin connection.  It has a \"lightning\" connection, which makes all my iPhone accessories obsolete until I can find a new type of extender cable for lightning connections.Joseph B. Hoyos"}

Or for newer tunes, you can automatically download lyrics directly from the internet database over into your mp3 files while the editor is running, saving all that typing :\/To preview the database editor before buying the player, just go to the jetaudio website and download it for a trial.Notice how you can pause the music file playing on the PC editor screen and then manually type in text, which will then appear right there at that exact time spot, on that exact track everytime the player plays that exact music file.

{"reviewerID":"A1HG5GLO2HDDSJ","reviewText":"I've now owned three bluetooth mouses; the Logitech V270, which I liked but was large and heavy and eventually broke - after years of use.  Then the Kensington slimblade BT presenter mouse, which neither I nor my dad liked for various reasons (see reviews of that product).Finally, I bought this Thinkpad mouse for both me and my dad and we both love it.Battery life is good, it's small enough for travel, big enough to use all the time and it feels and works very well and no problems at all over 3 months use.  Price is a bit high, so I hope it keeps going for a long while !Now it's May 2011 and my mouse is still working great.  I'm so impressed with this one.  I live right on the ocean and it's still working great, amazing battery life, easiest battery change when you do.  It's still really comfortable to use day after day.  I also bought a little Microsoft 5000 Bluetooth Mouse this year for my spare laptop, but the batteries are always dead on it.  It just does not compare in any way.After two years here on the coast, I should note that I have had a problem with the right button being a bit slow or flaky, but it gets salt air, used wet around the kitchen, gunky and still, the button got better on it's own.  I still consider it best and most reliable bluetooth mouse out there by far.  I'd rather have this one than two of any other bluetooth mouse.  It's worth the premium.---------------------------------OK, it's now a few months later and the right mouse button is pretty much dead.  Frustrating.  The rest works fine.  My dad has one and his left mouse button is sometimes bad after two years in a smoking environment.  Not terrible considering conditions, but for that reason I dropped the rating to four stars.  I like this mouse so much, I guess I'll buy another....but for the price, it really should last."}

{"reviewerID":"A3D1TZH619NKHN","reviewText":"So far, I am impressed with the Logitech MK300 wireless keyboard and mouse. I have used it daily for several weeks, and it has worked great. I have owned wireless mice and keyboards previously but they have been disappointing, some barely satisfactory at best. But so far the Logitech MK300 has been terrific.One setup I have used this with is a laptop sitting on a coffee table, hooked up to a big-screen TV with the Logitech USB communication device plugged in. I sit in an armchair with the keyboard on my lap, and the mouse on a nearby end table. I work from there. It is by far the most comfortable set-up that I have ever had, and can work for hours like this, made possible only by this wireless keyboard and mouse, which, so far, have worked flawlessly.The setup is easy to use - just plug and play for basic keyboard and mouse functions, so I am happy to say that this setup is user friendly and requires little thought for getting it up and running. There is an adaptor\/ communication device that plugs directly into a USB portal of the computer. The adaptor has a long cord to help bridge the distance between computer and keyboard if they are far from one another. There is a button on the top of the adaptor that is used to help the keyboard and mouse actively link to your computer, so long as they have batteries. On the back of both the keyboard and the mouse is red connection button, also used for communicating with the computer. The mouse has an additional on\/off switch to help save the life of the battery (I suggest using it). Once everything is plugged in and switched on it should work without a hitch.  I don't even use a mouse pad (although it is advisable) and find that the keyboard and mouse work the computer without hesitation or error.The only drawback, and it is minor, with this setup is that the keyboard can go through batteries if the communicator device (plugged into your computer) is more than three or four feet away from the keyboard and mouse. I was slightly more than four feet away and the battery in the keyboard only lasted one week. I replaced the batteries (it requires 2 AAA batteries) in the keyboard, moved the end of the communication device closer (less than three feet away) and so far haven't had any more issues with the battery. Having the USB communication device on a cord gives a little more freedom in range from the computer, or you can keep the cord wound up if you are working close by. For me, the cord works better than the short USB stub on my other wireless mouse. Both the keyboard and mouse have worked flawlessly for two weeks and counting, even after the keyboard took an unexpected crash trip to the floor, which speaks well for its durability.You will know when the battery is getting low, the keyboard and mouse react slower than expected and the keyboard will type incorrect letters, which can be frustrating until you realize that it just needs new batteries.  The keyboard is thin and lightweight and also has audio control and internet\/email buttons along with a driver CD, which I installed for testing these features.  They work fine, but I don't use them and uninstalled it afterward.Edited to add:  The keyboard takes AAA batteries as mentioned above, but the mouse takes AA batteries.  Also, the Delete\/Home\/End\/Page Up-Down button configuration is different than a traditional keyboard, which has lead to a few mis-types on occasion."}

On mine, one of the sets of threads was thin and the threaded band would jump thread to thread like it was stripped so it wouldn't grasp the wire firmly. It took a few tries to get the wire in place where it would cock the threaded band but I was able to get it to finally grab on the threads and not slip loose. It's tenuous though. Once everything is tucked away in the wall, and if the wiring stays well tight, you should be fine. But it took a bit to get the one terminal to work properly."}
{"reviewerID":"A1OWGURY760NPE","reviewText":"The overall design of this keyboard is pretty neat. It's very thin and adds very little bulk to the tablet. Typing on it isn't as easy as I had hoped. The keys are much smaller than expected and do not present a natural typing feel. The space bar is very difficult to get to due to it's size and because the tab to secure the case to the tablet is directly in front of it. The keyboard clips on snugly but does slide from side to side easily. Overall I'd say if you want a keyboard with you all the time and don't care that it's a compromised one this is a great product for the price.

{"reviewerID":"A28UMA3GW9L124","reviewText":"(Fear not. This is a legitimate review. Even though the Zentral for iPhone has not been released yet I had a chance to receive one through the Amazon Vine program).I had high hopes for the Audiovox Zentral. I've been using Logitech Harmony remotes throughout the house and I thought that this would be a great addition because every member of the household has an iPhone and we usually have no trouble finding them but always seem to lose the remotes.You can read my detailed notes below but to summarize: I can't recommend this device because it's too difficult to enter devices and configure activities. It's like one of those old fashioned universal remotes that let's you combine all of the functionality of your remotes into one but doesn't add any intelligence. This is in sharp contrast to the Logitech Harmony remotes that let you provide Manufacturer\/Model info and then do most of the work for you.On the positive side:+ The main Zentral unit is an IR Blaster that's powered by a 300ma (low power) power supply. It's intended to be placed so that it faces the equipment you want to control. It's small and unobtrusive and definitely powerful enough.+ The iPhone communicates with the Zentral through bluetooth. The range is decent and pairing is simple. Because it's bluetooth you don't need line of sight between the iPhone and the Zentral.+ Six (6) tiny IR Transmitters are included in case you need to place the Zentral next to your equipment rather than facing it (i.e. no line of sight)Zen+ Some of the setup work can be done on the iPhone and the more complicated stuff (like Activity Control - where you operate several devices at once. e.g. Watch DVD might operate a DVD Player as well as a TV and a Receiver for different functions) can be done the ZentralApp(dot)com website.+ You can share device settings with other members of your household that have Blackberrys and iPhones+ There's a TV Guide built into the app+ You can record macrosOn the down side. It's nothing like the Logitech Harmony remotes when it comes to programming devices and activities:-You can only enter manufacturer names and device types. After that you're on your own. You can't choose the model number of the device and you have to pick from one or more set of IR Codes. For comparison the Logitech Harmony gives you a chance to enter the model number and then figures out what codes you need.-Activities just give you the ability to control multiple devices. By comparison, the Logitech Harmony asks you how you configure your TV and Receiver inputs for each activity and then automatically let's you turn\/off\/configure devices for each activity and automatically assigns the most useful commands to the remote buttons.-No support for devices that use RF (radio frequency) instead of IR. For example: Vudu, DirecTV receivers etc. RF is not line of sight so in general it's much better than IR."}

{"reviewerID":"A1PGUHJ9ZN499P","reviewText":"The soft cover offers the following key features making its purchase a smart decision for anyone who owns or are looking at buying a Soundlink Mini:1.  It offers protection in all the right places while creating a bumper around the edges to protect the exposed grill.  This is vastly superior to the folding cover on the Soundlink II.  The Soundlink II leaves the prone to dings edges exposed.  As feared,  my Soundlink II shows signs of contact on its corners despite never realizing it had knocked into something.  I'm glad to be worry free about the same thing happening to my Mini with this cover in place.2. As expected it is easy to install and fits perfectly.  It retains the overall physical appeal of the speaker with the color choices adding a little fun to the classy look of the speaker.3. The price may seem a little high,  but if you consider the price of some phone covers it seems more reasonable.  I had initially planned on buying the relatively expensive travel case,  but after seeing how well this adds protection it has eliminated the need for that extra purchase.Sure I would have loved it if this came with the speaker to begin with,  but would rather it came with the included charging platform that would have likely been a much more expensive accessory if purchased separately.  The cover is designed well,  looks good and well worth the price."}
{"reviewerID":"A1GYN77I2M4LQN","reviewText":"I am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me. So, I have all the very expensive stuff, including KODAK's $20m commercial digital cameras. So, I know what quality  is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line as starters, the DC280 makes great  color shots with very suprising Hi-detail. The Advertisments say  &quot;good&quot; for 8x10 photos, however, as a very picky guy, when you  get past 5x7 print sizes, the pictures start to turn fuzzy. But the 5x7  prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. But, so what, how many  prints does one make larger than 5x7 anyway. This camera is easy to use  &amp; small, and I carry it on vacation locations, when I don't want to  carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly shocked at the  excellent picture quality of the 280. ALSO, KODAK includes great software,  so after a picture taking day\/nite, one can easily connect to the yellow  video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show of the days  activities. I would recommend purchasing a 64MB memory card with the camera  purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture opportunities (75+ shots) without  having to worry about using up memory. In other words, since you can erase  shots you don't like, take MANY, MANY shots and pick the best ones you like  for printing or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the  evening, I can copy the photo-files to the hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, in preparation for the next days photo activities. KODAK  provides serial, USB cables, and software to accomplish this simply.  Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera with less than 2,000,000 pixels.  (The older models, presently having good sale prices, are technology of 2\/3  years ago, and you'll wish you spent the extra money for this camera).  Since KODAK has been the color business for 100 years, (well...50+years)  its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip)  with the BEST Color quality and detail. This is a must have, you'll not be  dissappointed. If you have another few hundred dollars, check out the SONY  or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers, which produce actual photo quality  continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes; These printers are not dot-matrix's  with all the little dots. The camera and the printer makes for a great  combo family gift for under $2m, that anyone in the family can use without  having to even turn on a computer, as the printer prints directly off the  camera memory card. SO that you don't make yourself craze, and since its  slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera, be sure to  read the instruciton booklet, before pushing all the buttons. The  documentation KODAK gives you is very easy to understand, so take it slow  when you open the Box for the first time. It's so intuitive to use, after  the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going back to the booklets.  JLW\/991203."}

I gave it 3 stars because for the price ($65)I feel I got considerable use out of it though, of course, I would have liked much more.  I was disgusted to find that the warranty was only 90 days.  I've let Toshiba know that if I don't get some reasonable response from them to this failure that Toshiba will not be a contender when  I buy a laptop and HDTV later this year."}

This battery also charges in the charger that came with the camera.  I Don't know if this battery will charge as many times as the original but I'm bettin this one will last long enough.  One thing you should realize is that whether using the original camera battery or this replacement neither will last a long time recording video.  I highly recommend buying this battery.  If I need a 3rd battery I will definetly buy this one again.  Plain and simple if it works \"Why Pay More?\""}

{"reviewerID":"AH7EXK88CDMP9","reviewText":"This case was designed to be simple, but in actuality quality control on the design of the case was very poor. In order to fit my 2.5\" 250GB HD into the case I had to remove the SATA\/USB converter with pliers and attach it to the drive. After measuring the thickness of the overall case with vernier calipers and adjusting the measurement for the thickness of the aluminum I found that this HD case is actually a fraction of a millimeter smaller than a standard case should be. 2.5\" internal HDs usually range from 9-11 millimeters and this case measures an internal depth of 8.8. It did the job perfectly well, but I would not buy another."}

{"reviewerID":"A2NOIWPJDD7WIQ","reviewText":"I guess releasing a bargain priced 4GB video camera shooting in 720P makes sense for the value conscientious minded consumer. But there are 2 key features missing in this bargain video camera: Image Stabilization and 60fps (the 4GB model only shoots at 30fps, trust me, there's a huge difference in video quality and fluidity). I was okay with the 4GB Flip UltraHD until I realized that whenever I shot personal events that involved people MOVING, it was sort of choppy (even in well lit areas).  It so happens that my co-worker had the Flip UltraHD 8GB and it had Image Stabilization and shot in 60fps.  Talk about a huge difference. You might as well shell out the extra $50-$60 for the 8GB model because the Image Stabilization makes a huge difference.  And 60fps vs. 30fps is huge too.  If you're not big on visual quality and fluidity in your home made movies, this is the camera for you.  But if you want more bang for your buck, shell out the extra dough for the 8GB model. You won't be sorry that you did., This product does what it's expected to do, which is somewhat charge the Nexus 10 slightly quicker. I emphasize the word 'slightly' because all in all, charging the Nexus 10 just takes forever in general.  What I do like about the pogo cable is that you can actually work on your tablet with the thing connected and you will not lose battery power (or the battery power will not drain as quickly as it would if you used the microUSB charging method instead).  Other Nexus 10 owners like myself noticed that even when you had the microUSB cable attached to charge while you were fiddling with the tablet, you'd still lose battery power! The pogo charger method somewhat fixes that.  I can multitask and watch videos, etc. etc. while having the pogo cable attached to charge it and the battery level will not decrease (or not decrease as quickly). It's a flimsy product. For $25, you would think the presentation of the item would be nice the second you got it in the mail. In this case, when I got the item, it was presented in a beat up bubblewrap manila pouch, inside was a small ziplock bag and inside that, there was the cable which was wrapped up in a tissue paper material type of pouch (so a manila paper pouch within a ziplock plastic pouch within a tissue paper pouch).  It just felt like something you could get at a flea market for about $2.  It's flimsy and it will connect to your pogo connector on your Nexus 10 quite easily, but it does seem very fragile to the touch.  I'm afraid that the casing around the pogo connection on the cable will eventually chip.  It comes with a rubber cap to somehow protect the pogo connector, but it doesn't even stay on firmly.  For $25, it sure is steep for something that will charge your Nexus 10 just a TAD quicker. But aside from that, I'd recommend this product even more if the price wasn't so steep. At least put the item in a nice box or packaging."}
{"reviewerID":"A1QRPS86NWHRZE","reviewText":"BUILD QUALITY: ***** (5\/5)This camera is a beauty! The top looks like finely brushed metal, the front is covered in perfectly inlaid leatherette, and the body is styled slim but curvy (for the handgrip), with sparse buttons and few logos. If it said \"Leica\" instead of \"Samsung\", I'd have no reason to doubt it. The bottom of the camera is definitely made of plastic though, and the black kit lens and flash don't entirely match the retro look - still, this looks and feels great.TAKING PICTURES: **** (4\/5)For my smallish hands, this camera is a perfect fit: slim and solid, but not too heavy, and as easy to hold with one hand as with two. The touchscreen has great colors (being OLED) and is very responsive, presenting an uncluttered view with quick access to parameters or goodies like touch- to- shoot. To my surprise, there is only one mode dial (P, A, S, M..) on the camera, and only one other dial - so if there are two things to set (like shutter and aperture in M mode, or shutter and exposure in the other modes), you have to press a \"shift\" button. A little odd, but workable.More annoying (and the reason to withhold one star) is the chatty menu system. When I so much as switch to a shooting mode, a full screen tells me what I just did (really, I know what \"A\" mode is for!), and this chattiness carries over to all settings: often, a popup would spring up and obstruct what I was just trying to read or adjust! Also on the minus side is that the screen is quite reflective and not easy to read out in bright sunlight.Focusing is a middle- of- the- road deal: better than most Point and Shoots, but not spectacular in its own class, and absolutely no match to a DSLR.PICTURE QUALITY: **** (4\/5)The spec is great (20 Megapixel CMOS APS-C sensor), and I'd say the picture quality is .. okay for that class. To compare with other \"outsider\" (non- Oly\/Panasonic) cameras, I think the Fujis - even the very cheap XA-1 - give more \"wow for the money\", but the Samsung is capable of decent quality pictures, too. In good to dimmer light, the photos look more DSLR- like (which they should), with great color and little noise.The sensor shows its weaknesses with higher ISOs and low light, and that is acerbated by a substandard in- camera JPEG engine. In general, it doesn't reduce noise well, and tends to oversaturate. Now all that said, JPEG low- light performance doesn't faze me all that much, because those should be shot in RAW anyway. And here's the best news of all:SOFTWARE: ***** (5\/5)I've been corrected in other camera reviews: supposedly it's normal for $1000 cameras to come with awful software. I disagreed then, and Samsung shows how it's done: they include a full version of Lightroom 4. Of course it would be better to have a free Lightroom 5 in the box, but even V4 is leaps and bounds above what other manufacturers offer. On a side note, Lightroom 4 runs pretty nicely in a VirtualBox under Linux, whereas SilkyPix (Fuji and Panasonic's choice) just crawls. The NX-300 is perfectly supported of course: distortion or CA corrections are one- click, and it really does magic with RAW pictures (see customer images for an example). Big Thumbs up to Samsung for that move!WIFI: ***** (5\/5)Most cameras have Wifi today, but the NX300 goes above common expectations, in good and bad ways. On the plus side, the Wifi can do 5Ghz, and there are many share options, ranging from email, over social media, to \"cloud\" and smartphone sync. On the somewhat eerie side, email doesn't need your server credentials (meaning, the pictures go to Samsung, who then sends it out on your behalf), and the camera informs you of available firmware upgrades (which is helpful, but a bit strange for a camera to talk home - maybe I just need to get on with the social crowd).OVERALL: **** (4\/5)This is a very nice camera with great build quality, good picture quality, and lots of features. I think it'll please social medialites as well as more serious enthusiasts, and it comes with a copy of Lightroom 4 to take full advantage of the sensor's capabilities."}

They don't block much as much sound as the spec indicates (stated attenuation is comparable to my foam earplugs, but they are nowhere near as effective at blocking outside noise). They do tone down outside high frequencies a bit, just enough to take the edge off, but not enough to impede normal conversation or even listening to my stereo.  The short cable introduces a ton of noise; every time it touches my shirt or the edge of my table it makes a noise in the ear louder than whatever program I'm listening to via the headphones. Sound is otherwise just OK (I am a bit of an audiophile, but I really wasn't expecting all that much).  They are dirt cheap ($10-$20), and easy to wear, but otherwise...meh. Unless you really can't afford more than $15 (in which case you probably have better uses for $ than headphones, like food and rent!) I'd recommend getting something better.

{"reviewerID":"ASQE6CIJXX6HH","reviewText":"I've had the drive (Iomega 1.5 Tb) for about 2 weeks now, and it works great.  It's a Samsung drive in the enclosure; Windows reports that it's NTFS, 1,500,299,264,000 bytes\/1.36 terabytes.  That's how vendors sell storage - I don't like it, but it's what the fine print on the box says.Anyway, it works perfectly with my old XP pc.  Plug'n'play, no software needed, which is a big plus compared to the Seagate that I just returned.  One thing to be aware of:  I found out that the BIOS on older pc's (like mine) won't recognize a large-capacity drive on startup.  This means the computer won't boot up if the drive is on - no big deal, I just make sure it's switched off.  Because I have to use the switch, the drive is sitting on top of my desk (rather than underneath, as I was planning).  I'm glad it's an attractive enclosure - I didn't care about looks when I bought it.  The brushed aluminum doesn't show fingerprints much.  If you've got an older pc, the power switch is an important feature - without it, you'd have to unplug the USB.  The supplied USB cable is 3 feet, too short for my desk, so I swapped in a longer one.The drive works perfectly.  Other reviewers clock the speed - all I know is, it's fast enough for seamless 1080 video playback.So, I'm very happy with this purchase.  All my files are now backed up, and I've got tons of video on-call when I want it.  I like the 3-year warranty (if you register online).  All I ask now is that it last for years.

{"reviewerID":"A1PQK9OTGHDY08","reviewText":"Like just about anyone out there, I got this lens along with my Canon XSi, thinking it'll be a good starter lens to practice.  And it was.  But shortly thereafter I got the Canon 50mm 1.8, since it was so cheap, and pretty much never used 18-55 after that.The only time I'd use it, is indoors, where 50mm was just too tele-.  But even then, although having 18mm helped, having f3.5-5.6 certainly did NOT, making this lens too slow for indoors even on a reasonably bright day, and forcing me to use a flash (read: you might want to buy extra batteries and invest in a Canon 430 EX II, which is about $250, so you're likely not going to save much money by going with 18-55).  Plus, its 18mm end is a bit too wide for a pleasing portrait...So, if I were to do it all over again, I'd pass on this lens.  Right now, the difference between buying just the body of XSi and buying XSi+ this lens is roughly $50.  You can find a 50mm 1.8 for about $100, $90 if you wait a bit, $80 if you go used or get really lucky.  So, if you get the body sans this lens, all you need is another $50 or less to get a prime lens.  I think it's very much worth it.  Sure, with a prime, you miss out on the versatility of the zoom, but you'll get a faster lens and a better lens.If you absolutely feel that you need a zoom, I would strongly recommend checking out Tamron and Sigma.  I do not own one myself (and generally prefer primes), so I won't go recommending any one in particular, but it sounds from some reviews that they are at least worth considering.Finally, just wanted to mention: I'm trying to sell this lens right now, and unlike the 2 other lenses I have (one of which was 50mm), it's proving difficult.  No surprise here, given that everyone buys one, so there must be tons of them floating around.  Just saying - do not look at its $170 tag and think that you can sell it for a generous profit later, when you outgrow it (which, if you're any serious about photography, will happen soon).  The used ones on Amazon go at $92, which is a steep price drop for a lens, you usually do not expect to buy a used less for nearly 50% off.  And there are 30 of them (used) on Amazon at this time.  Also a large number, compared to other lenses.  So, I think you'll be lucky to get $80 for it when you sell, which means you'll make a whooping $30!"}

{"reviewerID":"AHVWHHTYV3GMP","reviewText":"I bought this TV to replace a 24 inches, 8 years old Sony LCD 4:3 aspect ratio TV which ran it course (still perfectly fine, just obsolete). I have always being amazed by the picture quality of that non-HDTV, picture was crisp and perfect, colors real and the experience of watching that TV was always a pleasure. So naturally I thought of another Sony to replace it.  Even if Sony always charges a premium, I believe it is justified: I've seen Sonys running side-by-side with Samsungs, Sharps, Vizio, Philips, etc and Sony always have a edge on picture quality, substantial over Samsung for example and just slight over Vizio, but an advantage nevertheless.For this Sony, the price premium was small so for me it was no brainer and I'm not disappointed: image quality is superb, even standard definition programs look razor-sharp and clear, no blur, no lack of black, etc, it is just amazing. And the auto-wide function makes watching SD programming a pleasure, as it will always adjust itself to give you the best watching experience. I have it connected to an Apple TV, as some suggested here it is better to pay about $300 for this TV and $99 for an Apple TV than $400 for a smart or connected TV, you get way more functionality and flexibility with a separate streaming device I think, being it an Apple TV, a Roku or whatever you prefer.And it is when delivering HD content that this TV really excels: Netflix or HBOGo streaming looks amazing, this TV leaves nothing behind, quality is outstanding in every situation I've faced: TV shows, cartoons, movies, news, etc, etc, you name it. This is what Sony is about, straight picture excellence without too many bells and whistles, simplicity and focus on what's really important on a TV which is picture qualityHaving said this, apart from a solid, outstanding image delivery, the rest of this TV is pretty average and even below from what some of the competition offers: only two HDMI ports (at this price range, 3 or 4 ports is the norm), one USB port which I guess is enough, one component input and one antenna connection. That's it. Oh, and one optical audio out which is the bright spot of this simplicity as it sounds really good, even if not really needed as the quality of the built-in speakers is also very good. Taken aside the screen, the rest of the materials used are cheap, thermoformed plastic, it looks OK but not great, and when compared with my old Sony they look subpar. But it is not something that will stand out and being so slim it is not really an issue as it will blend with the rest of the ambient. And I guess all this plastic helps to keep the TV very, very lightLastly, is the issue I'm sure many of you have seriously considered or at least gave some thought about it: 720P vs. 1080p? I did think about  this issue, did some research and agree with most of the experts: at this size 1080p is not a must have unless you sit very close to the TV (I would say 4 feet or less) and even then it will be hard to appreciate a real difference in image superiority from a 1080p. Unless you're a professional or again, sit very, very close to the TV or have superior eyesight which is a possibility, some people do have it; the 720p offered by this TV is excellent. Besides, at this price point and screen size it will very hard t o find a 1080p 32 inches TV, unless it is a connected or smart TV, and those are $100-150 more"}

The only drawback is the A125S has a battery life of only 6 hours, so I decided to try the Motorola D650 in hopes of a longer play time. Here are my complaints; The D650 drains the iPod battery quickly. When you pause your iPod for more than 60 seconds or so, the D650 powers off. When you start playing your iPod again, the D650 has to resync with the headset. Most of the time the resynch takes several minutes minutes and required repeatedly unplugging and plugging in the D650, starting and pausing the iPod, placing the headset back in pairing mode, etc. After owning the Motorola D650 for all of 5 days, it died completely. Unless your looking for poor quality, poor design and poor performance, don't bother buying a Motorola D650.BTW - I've since purchased a Sony TMR-BT8IP. It costs more than the D650, but it performs superbly. Easy to synch and it stays synched, excellent power conservation, resistant to external emanations (microwaves, PC's etc.)"}

I have used them for connecting my cable box, Xbox 360 as well as to my sound receiver and these perform as you would expect any HDMI cable.  The only downside that keeps me from giving it a perfect 5 star rating is that they are not very flexible due to their coating on the cables.  The increased thickness and fabric layer on them makes it tough to fold up the cables and have a clean look.  They do not bend like most cables and can be rough to deal with in tight spaces with a lot of cables going back and forth."}

{"reviewerID":"A2CH6FUYGYDV4I","reviewText":"I just bought the AD700s, and I do not have a small head.  I wear L or XL fitted hats, and XXL motorcycle helmets.  My head is something like 6.25\" wide (no calipers -- had to use a tape measure and a mirror), and almost exactly 24\" in circumference. The tops of the ear pads were each about a half-inch away from TOUCHING my head, let alone fitting properly.  The rubber band trick gets me about 5% of the way there.  I needed to severely bend the metal bars until the head-pad wings are overlapping by about a half-inch at rest, and the tops of the pads are still about a quarter-inch away from my noggin.  UPDATE: I previously did a one-bend trick, just squishing the sides together until the steel bars took a new set.  It looked a little cone-headey.  I just bent them some more, using a compound curve -- I bent the center in, to a much sharper curve, then bent the bars OUT at the bottoms, just above the ear cups.  It now fits MUCH much better, actually touching my head at both the top and bottom.  Looks even more cone-headey now.  But you know what? They finally fit! (Posting a photo shortly)Sound quality is quite good, though they really are bass-light.  I'm listening to a frequency generator app on my iPhone 4 right now.  At 120Hz, they start dropping off.  By 80Hz, they're definitely noticeably lower in response. At about 50Hz, they're still audible, but significantly dropped off.  45, even with the volume jacked all the way up, it's really losing it. 40, barely audible, and by 35 gone for all intents and purposes.  On the other end of the spectrum, either the headphones or my hearing drops off around 16.5kHz. Either is entirely possible, and either way, it's a lot higher than is pleasant to hear. No complaints up in that range.  In between, I can hear a peak around 2500-3000Hz, a dip around 3300-3700Hz, then building slowly back up to another peak around 5700Hz  A few more peaks and valleys between there and 16000, but nothing as obvious.Some might argue that the iPhone is generating some of that unevenness, and to some degree they'd probably be right, but I think it would be a very small degree.  If I can hear it, it's a big change. I'm not THAT sensitive.  I just double-checked myself against HeadRoom's published freq. response graph for the AD700s, and it and I agree, except they show a big peak up around 9000Hz, where I was hearing it around 5600.Of course, frequency response isn't all there is to a good set of heaphones, but it sure does make a good reference point for comparisons. Once you know what you like and can see how that frequency response plot looks, you have a good baseline to start from.  And it WILL tell you whether or not they're going to be bass-light, as these definitely are.  However, it CAN be fixed in equalization.  They're down a lot in the lows, but not so much a standard 12dB boost can't fix it.  The EQ built into iTunes is taking care of me fairly well.  I'm thinking about buying a dual-channel 31-band equalizer to get the most out of these (and any others I buy in the future).  Most people would be much better served just buying the headphones with the sound signature they want in the first place, though.Bottom line: They sound fantastic, if you EQ some bass back into them.  Mids and highs sound great to me. Soundstage is top-notch. They fit okay after I did a lot of bending.  Measure your melon.  If your head is 7.5 inches wide or more at the tops of your ears, these should fit you pretty well.  7\" might be okay. 6-6.5 (like me), they'll need a LOT of work."}

The drive arrived very well packaged from Amazon, and it was a very simple operation to swap it into the HP server drive sled and plug it in.  The \"restore\" operation was a bit slow (especially over a wireless connection), but I was delighted to find that we had lost NO data (due to drive mirroring).  I would heartily recommend this very-large-capacity drive to other MediaSmart Server users as a simple plug-and-play upgrade.  Think about it:  2TB of storage for under $100... and if you're not replacing a failed disk, this can go straight into an open bay for full mirroring of your digital data and memories.  Great deal for some peace of mind."}
{"reviewerID":"A3006WHOAYJRLI","reviewText":"These Jaybird JF4s are designed for people who listen to audio while working out or otherwise being active, and are willing to pay a large premium for that.  Using Bluetooth wireless, there are no wires to get tangled in or get yanked out, they're sweat-proof (not waterproof--don't wear them in the rain or shower!), and they do stay in your ears if you set them up with the appropriately-sized extensive hardware that they come with to fit your ear size.  I wear them at the gym and they've never popped out.  The cord sits on the back of the neck.  It doesn't bother me much, although I'm not crazy about feeling a rubber wire rub on my neck every time I move my head.As Jaybird acknowledges, the range of the signal isn't more than a few feet--you can't use these while leaving your phone in one place and walking around the house.  But it's weaker than that: you have to keep your cellphone on your right side, on your waist or on your arm, for the signal to work.  If you keep it in your pocket, it cuts in and out.  That alone makes it virtually useless if you don't care to wear a belt clip or arm band.Some have said the sound isn't quite as good as the previous (and less expensive) model; I don't know because I didn't try those, but the sound quality of these is just OK. They're tuned with the treble relatively low, so there's little sizzle in the highs. Without question, if you're looking for anything close to audiophile quality with deep bass, full mid-range, and clear, crisp highs, these aren't designed for you.  For the price, there are other phones with much better sound, so I would recommend these only for people who really want not only the Bluetooth feature, but also the stay-in-your-ear, sweat-proof features, since that's a large part of what you're paying for.  I'm sorry to say that those who've complained that the sound isn't much better than cheap buds aren't exaggerating very much.These charge through a USB connection that uses a miniUSB port covered with a tiny plastic plug on the body of one of the phones.  I find that to get the plug into the port, I have to shove the plug away and jam the plug in, and the plug pushes against the plug.  I wonder how long that plug will last.The buds come with a very fancy little clamshell holder.The controls are tiny and confusing.  The features work, but rely on pushing tiny button controls on the right bud housing, and it takes some practice to, say, hit the right button in the right way to answer a call while you're listening to music.  It can be done, and it's convenient when you operate it as intended, but you do have to be motivated to figure out the multifunction controls and use them properly (those who already use Bluetooth headsets have a head start.) Pushing a button short, medium, or long causes different effects. I'd prefer a larger, simpler set of control buttons.  Not to mention better sound quality for this price."}

{"reviewerID":"A2AWDAJOV50842","reviewText":"Alas, they disappointed.The packaging of these earphones is certainly impressive if a little over the top and gives these things a lot of authority.  The mere act of unpacking them causes one to feel that he is handling some pretty special equipment.This feeling is reinforced by the extra expensive-looking magnetic snap carrying case and wire storage device.It is cemented by the two full sets of ear buds included in the packaging of which there are four different sizes (differentiated by colors) to best fit the different hole sizes found in the human ear canal.Unfortunately, the functionality of these ear phones kills the buzz generated by the elaborate packaging and the bonanza of accessories.  I tested these under many different conditions; driving, walking, sitting, sitting in a pub, lying in bed, and shopping and was disappointed pretty much right across the board.I used two different ear bud sizes and found the one too small to block out ambient noise such that I had to increase the volume uncomfortably in order to hear the music well (I listened to the pay version of Pandora on iPhone).  The other set fit snugly but made me uncomfortable because they created so much noise internally (I could almost hear myself think) that they became a distraction.  For instance, I could hear the clump, clump, clumping of my footfalls and every time I turned my head the pull of the chords created annoying sound in my ears, also chewing and drinking became sound events.The large size of the ear phones themselves is impressive, I guess, even if the sound quality wasn't 15 times better than the $20 less massive ones I own albeit the sound these produce is far more complex than those and other phones I own.This is the one compelling feature of these earphones, to wit, they do reproduce a much more complex and subtle sound than other ear phones I've listened through.  I, like another reviewer, heard sounds unnoticed when played before through different speakers\/ear phones.  A part of this is that computer speakers are so low tech and the digital tracks they play lo fi when compared to a digital recording or even a vinyl record played through a quality stereo.Another compelling feature is that these earphones are super efficient meaning that when lying still, I was able to listen with my phone volume set a 1 and still get a full range of sound.  I thought that was nice.For one to enjoy the complexity of the sound reproduction, these are best used when sitting or lying quietly but if I were going to go to that much effort, over the ear headphones would be my choice as a $300 pair of headphones is going to literally blow these away.Note that I suffer from tinitis and these really make me aware of this condition after a relatively short amount of time listening."}

The vinyl and interior paddding are still intact, it's just the plastic (cardboard?) inside that's broken. There's no fixing it. I had it approximately one month and two days when this happened, so it's out of amazon's return period. I am still going to purchase another, but at around twenty-five bucks, I just expected it to hold up a little better. I'm holding out hope that it was a freak accident and my next one will last longer, but if not, I'll be back on the market for yet another case."}

{"reviewerID":"AFWMVMPB2WVP9","reviewText":"This item was such a HUGE disappointment. Initially, it worked well. BUT the more it was used (we are only talking 50 rolls or so) the more it started to deteriorate. First came the noises. Then the grinding. Then the failures to load film. Forget trying to load the rolls of 40 pictures, it would bring this thing to a grinding halt in many cases. This thing was only built to scan maybe 25-50 rolls tops. Read the reviews on other websites. Others have had the same thing happen. Inevitable failure. AND this is my SECOND one, both with the same result. For Nikon to release such a poorly constructed product is surprising. Especially since the scanner (I have the Coolscan V) it goes in is actually a well built and excellent product.Bottom line...WAY too much money for a hunk of plastic with such poor construction. It will do the job if it is a small one (25-to 50 rolls, keep the number of rolls of 40 pictures to a minimum!).  Be prepared to use that warranty and send it back to Nikon at least once or twice. And wear a headset, becuase that grinding squeaking noise as it rolls your film out is unbearable!"}

After mucho reading of reviews I went with Tripp Lite. I have some other Tripp Lite strips at home, and they seem durable and nice. And the components inside are allegedly top-notch (although I wouldn't personally know).This is a new style of Super7. I have an older style Super7 and there are two main differences.The first is that on the new style the side plugs are closer to the end of the strip. My old style has them smack in the middle. That should not really affect anything at all, except for maybe aesthetics.The one major gripe, though, is the on\/off switch. The old style was this strong, stiff, bulky thing that required work to turn on or off. A good thing considering strips are often in the area of accidental kicks and shoves by one's feet.Unfortunately, the new Super7 features a week on\/off switch that can EASILY and accidentally be turned on or off. You now have to pay special attention to the location of the strip. Even my cat could accidentally flip this off. Not good when a computer is plugged into it.Two stars off for this new \"feature.\""}

{"reviewerID":"A1CKRQ1QE8TUBJ","reviewText":"I decided to use this product on a new I7 3770K with an Intel Extreme Motherboard build instead of the usual heat sink\/fan approach I've used previously.Installation will be either easy or tricky depending on two things:  Your (1) motherboard & (2) your case.  If you have a small case or the CPU socket is far away (micro-ATX) this will be a tough fit.  The radiator (which is hidden in the photos) is pretty big as is the fan.The installation of the cooling block is pretty straightforward and good instructions are provided for either Intel or AMD chips.  However, the fan & radiator will require a bit of thought, and the instructions provide almost no installation instructions here except for a single example.  More confusing, however, is the relationship of the fan to the radiator.I am using a Lian Li 9F case, and it is designed for the radiator to go OUTSIDE the case; in fact, mounting holes for liquid cooling are already there, and they fit in the Corsair H60 perfectly, however, that means that the rear case fan had to be removed and replace on the INSIDE of the case.  That left a gap on the top of the radiator, which I ended up using rubber grommets (not supplied) to  space the radiator evenly.  Better instructions would have worked tremendously well here, and a novice builder might struggle a bit.What I finally decided was the fan should blow out of the case, since it didn't make sense to blow the hot back back inside, and its always a good idea to keep positive pressure on the inside of the case to discourage dust from building up inside.So after all that, is it worth it?  Well there are several advantages.  First, this moves the heat outside the case, so the inside of the case is cooler to begin with.  Second, it de-clutters the inside of the case, which is important if you're building a PC that has a window to the inside.  Finally, in theory it lets you overclock a bit more reliably since the CPU temperatures should be cooler.In practice, I've cranked the Intel BIOS to full overclock (admittedly, pretty mild) and the fans didn't even run faster.  So I am liking this thing.  Its relatively quiet and seems to do the job with almost no fuss.2013-09-16: UPDATEI removed it from my PC.  It worked well from a cooling perspective, but it's a LOUD solution.  The pump itself has a bit of a whiny pump motor that simply overwhelms listening to quiet music.  If I was building an all-out gaming machine, I would use this again, but for a general purpose machine, I would look for a passive cooling solution."}

I can't believe they have a defective unit out of the box so I'm  figuring that is why they are now selling these for cheap.I do not want to return the item because I don't want to bother with the shipping and the hassle but as the saying goes you get what you paid for. I also ordered a 120 watt lite adapter made from Kensington for 30 dollars refurbished as a backup unit when this thing dies in 6 months.Another issue is that the plug to the wall is too short but I have a longer cord from another product that died on me awhile ago.Update: After a few weeks of use I noticed the tips are flimsy and will come off very easily I recommend you buy the 120 Watt Kensington adapter for 30 dollars refurbished or pay a little more and get a new one. I am not very impressed with this adapter except for the fact that the cord to the notebook is fixed and will not break.For whatever reason it stopped charging I was wrong this adapter didn't last eight months. I'm guessing its the fixed wire that shorted out or the tip is dead I know its not my laptop because I have two other chargers that works for my model.I figured out its the tip and requested they sent me a new one since they said in the warranty they sent out 1 replacement tip free.

{"reviewerID":"ADYCAO81TT4UP","reviewText":"First I must say that I absolutely love my GoPro HD Hero 2 camera.  It's compact and very versatile.  The video quality is great.  The audio quality is superb when used with a skeleton case.  The new WiFi BacPac makes it extremely easy to start and stop recording from far away.  I use my WiFi BacPac remote from inside my car when at the racetrack as my cameras are usually mounted to the outside of my car.-------------------------------------------------There are plenty of reviews of the GoPro HD Hero2 so I will focus on something not talked about too much, editing video with your GoPro HD Hero2.I used to own the HD Hero and now I own four HD Hero2 cameras.  Until recently I have been recording everything in WVGA (848x480) in both 60fps and 120fps.  I primarily recorded in 848x480 (WVGA) because the quality looked great and the file size remains relatively small when compared to 720p or 1080p.  I also liked the higher fps for slow motion.The problem with recording in 848x480 occurs when you trim a video clip (ex: Quicktime).  After using Quicktime to \"trim\" a clip you then have to export the clip.  The resolution remains the same but your 60fps video becomes 30fps (essentially you loose every other frame).  Your 120fps video is also converted to 30fps making your video look choppy.Another option is to use CineForm Studio to trim your clip.  After trimming in CineForm Studio, you can keep the current frame rate (ex: 59.94p) but you will loose every other frame just like trimming in Quicktime.  If you change the frame rate to 29.97p then you will maintain all frames but the playback will be at half speed.The real issues occur after you import into a video editing program (ex: iMovie).  To complete a simple task such as combining two clips together will require a video editing program.  848x480 is \"NOT\" a standard resolution.  An example of a standard resolution would be either 480x360 or 640x480.  After editing you have to export your video in a standard resolution which is not a native resolution for your GoPro camera.  This causes your video quality to become very blurry with washed out colors and loss of definition.The only solution I found thus far in dealing with GoPro WVGA (848x480) resolution is to import into Final Cut Pro X ($299 at the moment), then \"Control + Click\" the file and choose \"Open in Timeline\" which will create a Compound Clip.  Compound Clips will allow you to work with 60fps and use a custom resolution (ex: 848x480).  You can also export using this native resolution with essentially no loss in video quality.  I'm don't know about dealing with custom resolutions on a PC although I'm sure there exists a solution.The other solution is to just record everything in either 720p or 1080p which nearly all PC & Mac programs support."}

{"reviewerID":"A2AZXU0QBSR2P9","reviewText":"In short: I think the Nuvi 3490LMT is a fairly good, though extravagant (and so priced) product.  While it has some advantages over my prior GPS solution, it also has some significant quirks and oddities.  I would probably rate it about 7 of 10; I don't think it deserves 4 stars, and while it seems better than three, I decided it is probably better to round down.I've been using DeLorme software on a PC with a GPS receiver as a regular navigation tool for a long time now (over ten years), and tinkered with GPS back when the better handheld devices offered breadcrumb trails on a matrix screen with coordinates and nothing else.  I'm used to how the DeLorme products behave, but decided dragging around a laptop, GPS receiver, and about at least twenty feet of various interconnecting cables (plus a power adapter and cables and inverter and cables for the PC if I wanted to use it for more than a couple hours).  Frankly, I like that system enough that if I could figure out a way to make it easier to manage, I would.Portability and convenience finally won out.  Trading my 15 inch diagonal 4:3 ratio 1600*1200 pixel display for a 4.3 inch diagonal 16:9 ratio 800*480 pixel display makes it all feel cramped, but I think I can deal with the smaller panel in exchange for being able to set it up and get running in under a minute (versus about 15 minutes for the laptop based setup -- 12 minutes placing and anchoring it and wiring it together, 2 minutes boot, 1 minute to get GPS fix).  The touchscreen has benefits too, not having to deal with keyboard or mouse use when trying to accomplish something (so I don't have to pull over to do simple stuff anymore).Despite the details I try to provide with the issues I have encountered below, my overall experience with the device has been positive.  Most of the time it simply works, gets me to within eyeshot of the destination, and the convenience of setting it up (pop it into the car mount and go) versus the PC solution is great.  It would be nice if the traffic feature worked more reliably, but that is not the primary reason I purchased it.I probably would have purchased a 5-inch model instead, but the features of this model were only available in this model when I purchased mine (there is now a 5-inch version, I think).  I'm not sold on the 'iPhone form factor' but I want reliability and utility and believe these are generally easier to obtain together in a slightly larger device.Honestly, technology prices continue to surprise me.  The PC rig cost me over two thousand dollars initially (less than a built-in GPS system at the time!); this thing cost less than a fifth of that and has features the PC rig did not have.  As far as overall value, keep in mind that this is one of the most extravagant models Garmin offers in this class, so it is pricey.  If all you want is basic GPS, a cheaper model will probably suit you; if you want all the extras, this might be a good one to consider (and the price has come down since I bought mine, naturally).Good* Screen is clear, crisp, bright, and legible even at nearly arm's length and in daylight (in order to hang it from the windscreen where it does not add significant obstruction, I put it as far away as I could while still able to comfortably reach it).  It also dims nicely, so it is not blinding or distracting (and still useful) when driving at night.* Speech recognition works fairly well.  You can change the activation phrase if you like, and if you feel silly conversing with it (or are just tired of waiting for the voice prompt to finish), you can turn off the voice prompts (so it simply beeps to acknowledge).* Can sit the device on a short edge to make the vertically challenged 16:9 widescreen display a far more useful (for seeing what is coming ahead) 9:16 tallscreen display.  The device recognises this and adjusts accordingly, even placing the exit view on top while keeping the overhead view visible on the bottom half.* Route generation seems to work reasonably well.  While there is no apparent way to add a 'via', adding intended vias as destinations along a route appears to achieve nearly the same result.* Route planning application lets you plan travel in advance, and then select the route and follow it when you are ready.* Generally quick GPS acquisition, and usually accurate position information.  It tries to 'snap to roads' (or to the active route) when driving, which tends to mitigate a limited amount of GPS offset.* I have not yet received any ads via the traffic feature, though I have gotten traffic reports.Things that should be improved* The route line is opaque while navigating, obscuring the road underneath.  It could be partially transparent and thus allow details of the road to be seen better (particularly coming up to complex interchanges or similar).* It would be nice to have a dashboard option that displays up to four data but makes the line (or lines in 'tallscreen' mode) shorter, to show more map.  One of the dashboards displays four items and is thinner than some of the others that only display two, but I'd like it still smaller so I can see more of the map (particularly when it is displaying an upcoming turn).* The current speed turns red when you are going over the limit.  This seems like a good idea, but perhaps a different colour would be better (more easily legible) against the grey background, or maybe leave the current speed white and make the limit sign change colour -- perhaps red on yellow.* The device claims 8GB capacity (closer to 7.5GB) and firmware+maps consume rather over 5GB of that after recent updates.  It was below 4GB used when I purchased the unit.  Makes me wonder just how long it will 'last' and whether I can move some of that stuff (like the maps) to the MicroSD card so there will be enough room for future firmware and map updates.* It would be nice to have a utility that backs up my information (locations, phone book, settings, logs) from the device -- perhaps an application on the device for copying my data to the MicroSD card, a feature under myDashboard or just put these data in a folder that Windows will show without requiring me to disable 'Hide protected operating system files' to back them up myself.* The traffic reports are not always helpful.  So far, about half the time it projects a delay, the estimated delay is wildly inaccurate (30 minute actual delay but it said 2 minutes) or not there at all (no delay but it said 15 minutes).  It has failed to predict almost as many delays as it has predicted accurately (said no delay but there was one of more than a few minutes).* There is no obvious difference in the traffic icon between traffic flowing well (green) and no traffic information (green).  The only time you know it is not getting any traffic information is when the icon turns grey, indicating the receiver is not connected or the feature is disabled.  Not sure whether this is because there is no 'all clear' traffic indication in the radio broadcasts (technical limitation), or if Garmin simply does not want to confuse the user with yet another colour (maybe blue to indicate receiver connected but no information?).* Sometimes a route takes a *long* time to find.  I mean hours.  I have not left it running overnight to see if it ever finishes, but I have exhausted the battery from full charge on a couple occasions letting it sit on a table to plan a route, with it stuck at some percentage after just a few minutes.  Maybe it should give up after some time (configurable would be nice).  Often changing the origin or destination by some distance will work around it, so maybe I am seeing the 'unroutable map tiles' problem.* Speech recognition sometimes activates from the radio -- on phrases or music plus words that too often seem to have nothing to do with the activation phrase.  I have had it try to do things (change the display, adjust brightness, choose new destination) while listening to talk radio or music.  Normally you can back out the command by saying 'exit', but...* In voice-dial mode, it will often not confirm making a call -- that is, you tell it to call somebody and it immediately dials (particularly if the person only has one number).  Unhappily, once it starts to dial, you must tap the screen (twice!) to cancel or end the call.  The first place is about fingertip sized, and missing it interprets the gesture as a map manipulation; the second place is near the opposite corner of the screen and it at least a larger area.  Good luck cancelling a call before it goes through.  There may be situations where it calling by voice command could be good, but I think there needs to be a confirmation before placing the call.  I do not like to use the phone when the car is in motion, so I have taken to disabling the bluetooth connection to my phone before I start moving.* Some things the speech recognition handles poorly: it does not like searching for points of interest where the name is an abbreviation or acronym; some words (so far only PoI names) must be pronounced very strangely before it accepts them.  Sometimes searching for a location is easier by typing.* The maps are not consistently current.  It lists, for example, a local post office that was closed two years ago, but does not list another post office that has been operating for several years (does not even have the road where this post office is located!).  Some things are reasonably up-to-date, but others seem to have been neglected.  It offers a way to mark a point of interest as 'closed' or 'missing' and says it will report this when I connect to myDashboard, but I do not see a way to note a new road or add a new point of interest, nor do I see a way to note a road as closed or missing (washed out bridge, landslide, blocked permanently, rerouted, &c;).* The maps do not show accurate PoI positions.  In many cases, it interpolates position of an address based upon numbers and distance between cross streets; this leads to thinking something is some distance up or down the street from where it really is.  If a PoI is set back some distance,  it still shows it on the street.  Usually it will get you within eyeshot of the destination, but this may not be sufficient without stopping somewhere safe and looking around (and maybe calling the destination for details).* GPS fix is occasionally (far) off during startup.  Sometimes it takes a couple to few minutes (longest I have seen is a bit over three minutes) before the GPS fix is 'correct'.  Most of the time it simply says it is looking for satellites, but sometimes it thinks it has a fix and is off by a few hundred metres.  Most of the time acquisition is within 30 seconds and at that point is initially accurate to a couple dozen metres (it is usually within 5 metres shortly after).* Dynamic zoom (when moving) feature is usually okay, but sometimes it would be nice to have some control (at least override the zoom), such as when looking at complex interchanges.  There is a way to override the zoom and to pan around, but once you do this, it sticks -- you have to exit this view and return to the 'default' map display before it will follow your position again.* Editing the speed limit does not always stick.  Sometimes it reverts in seconds, other times it will be okay for this trip but will revert for a future trip.Problems (can be worked around by user)* Sometimes I have to repeat myself on the speech recognition activation phrase, but if I turn down\/off the radio first, it is usually good on the first (or second) try (waiting a few seconds after turning the radio down\/off helps).* Sometimes speech recognition requires a *brief* input: searching for \"BJ's\" works well enough, but \"BJ's in North Raleigh\" often returns results completely unrelated to BJ's wholesale club or the northern area of Raleigh.  It would be nice if it would accept more specificity rather than having to scroll through as much of a list (some improvement can be obtained by the 'near current', 'near destination', 'along route' choice but it usually only helps a little and is only offered if you are already following a route).  You can put places you expect to visit more often in your saved places, and use that, but you may not want to clutter your saved places so much if you are only visiting an area occasionally.* myDashboard does not detect the device on Windows 7 Ultimate if it is in 'Media device' (MTP) mode.  I must set to 'mass storage' mode, then it seems to work.  There are instructions for doing this in various places.  WebUpdater and LifetimeMapUpdater have similar restrictions as myDashboard to seeing the device.* myDashboard continuously reports upgrades available, even when WebUpdater says the firmware is up to date and LifetimeMapUpdater says the map is up to date.* Must dismount ('Safely Remove') the device before disconnecting in Windows 7 Ultimate; I could not set the write policy for 'fast removal' as I normally do similar devices.  The documentation fails to mention this, and I believe I have had it fail to properly perform at least one update because I followed the instructions and simply unplugged it without first dismounting it.* With display in 'tallscreen' mode, and maps set to show 'north up', and exit view is displayed, the car's current position is often obscured by the 'dashboard' display, unless you have it set to one of those dashboards that provides less information (and some of those still hide the current position).  If you set the map to 3D or 'track up' it tends to do better.* The automatic orientation supports 'top up' (top is the side with the detent for the mount) and 'left up' (hold it with the top side up and the screen toward you and the side on the left is the 'left' side).  It does not support 'bottom up' (bottom is the side with the mount connector) or 'right up' (right is the side with the MicroSD slot).  If you hold it 'bottom up' it operates in 'top up' mode; if you hold it 'right up' it operates in 'left up' mode.  Makes handheld use a bit more interesting (must hold it at an angle to the ground else it may assume the wrong side is up or change the orientation unexpectedly).* Occasionally it gets into a state where it refuses to draw the track properly (instead it draws a single straight line from the point of initial fix to the current location).  This can be resolved (for a while at least) by resetting the device.  Even in this state, it still seems to record its history properly -- only seems to affect the track display (the rest of the map display seems unaffected by this, and the GPS location log appears correct after reset).* The bluetooth feature often decides (after achieving a connection) to disconnect from my phone.  I could go back in and enable it (this usually works for a while before it disables it again) but due to the voice recognition phone dialling behaviour, I have decided that it might be useful to have to deliberately attach the phone before using it.Bad (no apparent workaround, but could be fixed by Garmin)* The 3D display mode wastes about a quarter inch vertically of the dislay to draw an utterly useless band of 'sky'.  I fail to find even aesthetic value in it; I would prefer to turn it off to reclaim that area of the screen for the map.  Maybe on a 7 inch model this quarter inch tall waste of space would not matter as much, but it discards a noticeable percentage of the display space on this smaller device.* Unable to take the device out of storage mode while connected to PC for charging (would like to be able to use it with USB power rather than draining the battery).  None of the tricks I could find for this online work with current firmware for this model; had to buy a dedicated USB charger to be able to have the device powered and useful other than while in its mount.* Garmin's MapUpdater simply does not work with the device.* Garmin's LifetimeMapUpdater is one of those idiotic programs that reinstalls itself every time it runs if you disable it autostarting with Windows or if you move its icon and folder within your start menu to a more logical location in your start menu (such as grouping it under a 'utilities' folder).  It appears to run itself through the Windows installer even when you do not relocate its icon or remove it from autorun.* Garmin's myDashboard wants to run scripts or other content from Google Analytics.  I would rather be able to do this stuff with local software anyway, but linking in a marketing and traffic analysis site is disconcerting.* Device gets warm to the touch while running indoors in 'room temperature' air.  Not burning hot, but rather warm.  Putting it up in the windscreen on a *cold* sunny day and then taking it down later (it makes a fair hand warmer) is enough to make me wonder whether I will need a fan and shade on it during the warmer months.  Perhaps black was a poor colour choice for the back of the device, and the form factor reduces heat dissipation capability?  Maybe those vent mounts are a good idea for summer use?* No access to the battery.  High quality Li-Ion and Li-Polymer batteries have a service half-life of about three years (they lose about half their remaining capacity every three years after manufacture; cheaper ones usually have a shorter service half-life), if maintained under very specific laboratory conditions.  Real-world conditions are rarely as kind, and are quite horrid inside an automobile.  With a 'warm' case temperature, you can be assured the internals are indeed hot, and so the battery could not reasonably remain at ideal laboratory conditions even if the unit is somehow kept there.  In short, the battery will quite probably need to be replaced before the unit otherwise wears out.Minor -- details that might be nice to work out* The sort order for the suggestions lists appears to be linear distance (not travel distance).  While I understand the complications it would add to offer travel distance instead (finding a route to each of the suggestions), it might be nice to sort by other relatively easy criteria (alphabetically for example).* Traditional to everything these days, manufacturers know that (almost) nobody reads the manual and so the manual is lacking in almost all aspects.  It is probably what I would consider a good 'getting started' guide, but it covers few specifics and has fluff that does not apply to the device as shipped (but not in enough detail to be extremely useful even with the required accessories).  Thankfully a lot is either self-explanatory or there are places on the web that explain how to do it.* There is a whole section in the manual about ecoRoute, despite this not being included with the device (must purchase separately).  Considering how poorly the manual covers the included parts, adding this just seems insulting; tell the customers how to use a disabled\/hidden\/add-on feature in the documentation with the feature or its enabler, rather than in the base manual.* The manual mentions PoI add-ons for things like safety cameras, school zones, and other useful things, but does not give specifics about where to get them; the link it provides offers no information about these.  It also mentions a 'proximity alerts' settings screen that does not seem to exist.Pointless - does not matter to me* I consider music or audio book playing a useless feature in such a device as this: it has too many other things to do, the speech synthesis quality is somewhere between mediocre and fair (intelligible but unimpressive), there is no headphone\/earphone\/line out connection, and the built in speaker (or the mount speaker) might barely do justice to the sound quality of a child trying to slaughter a piano with a sledgehammer, keyboard first.  Somehow, listening to it maul music or drone out what should be an interesting book seems unappealing.* The included 'language guide' is a trial version that expires after 30 days.  Not sure what marks the first day (first use of device, first GPS fix, first use of the dictionary, when that warning is displayed).  Since it apparently only covers words and simple phrases, it is probably less useful in conversations significantly more complex than \"where is a bathroom?\".  The included guide curiously does not include all of the languages in which the machine claims to operate.* Supposedly it offers games and other applications as add-ons.  I would suggest that Garmin work out the kinks and problems for what the device was intended to do, before they try to make the device do even more.Additional notes (added 2012-12-29):Apparently a lot of the quirks on the ecoRoute HD accessory (see my review of that) are related to the firmware on this device (specifically, the limitations requiring the ecoRoute accessory be connected before certain features work.(edited 2013-02-01):Recent firmware updates finally made it where the ecoRoute HD 'gauges' application does not interfere with the voice instructions following a route, but the January 2013 firware update fixes a 'stability issue', this seems to have introduced, so you should probably update to that."}

{"reviewerID":"A2XI7UD9MWPC0Z","reviewText":"Would be my first choice as a DJ, if I were a DJ or needed excellent noise isolation.As a casual listener, not the best choice.I am not a DJ which is my mistake, therefore purchasing these was not the right choice when looking for excellent headphones for just listening to music.  If you're a casual music listener, you'll likely want something else.  I thought I was looking for accurate & level sound reproduction which these do indeed provide.  The sound quality on these are so good you can hear how bad your MP3s are.  I can't fault these on accurate sound reproduction or clarity.However, the very low-bass response on these headphones is a bit weak. At low volumes I can barely hear the bottom end.  Perhaps I need an amp, but that's precisely my point as to why you may not want these for casual listening, especially with an iPod or iPhone.  You definitely get all of the frequencies down to the lowest of lows, and most likely quite accurately but I'm used to slightly stronger bass for listening pleasure at low volumes.  With these most music sounds a little too strong in the mid range.  I find that usually I like the sound when I enable one of the EQ presets on the iPhone which boost the bass (or cuts the mids) just a little.Sound isolation is excellent.  I'd be surprised if any other headphones on the market could do better to any significant degree.  These fit snugly on-ear and cut out 90% of noise around me.  You can listen to your audio at low levels without outside sound interference.  These would be excellent for DJ use or in any loud environment like a trade show, sporting venue, etc.For casual listening I would recommend going with something marketed as such.Once again, these headphones are 5-stars for what they are intended for.  I wouldn't hesitate to get them for DJ or loud environment use."}

{"reviewerID":"A1L2QANSCBV0F7","reviewText":"I have an E-PL1 with 2 manual lens.(I used to be a proud owner of E-520.... so I am kind of used to take a picture looking through the VF.)I am one of those shaky-hands-people, which means I always get a blurry picture, especially if the light amount is low and I have to decrease the shutter speed to account for that. So I decided to look for an EVF, as I learnt from many website that placing the camera to your face can stabilize it a bit... After reading all interviews in here, BH, Adorama, etc., I think I should give it a try. Though my decision time is quite long... from started looking until decided to buy... it took me  .... 3 weeks to finally spend $240 for this little piece of technology!!!So... here come my thoughts about the piece:What I love...- Oh... it serves its purpose very, very well, -- an EVF! It helps to stabilize the camera when I need it to be stable. I took low light picture a lot better now with this -- don't have to bump up the ISO to 800 or 1600 anymore. Plus, taking a picture in the midday sunlight is not a problem anymore!- The picture you see through it is crisp, clear, and.... great!- Its vari-angle design enables you sometimes to be more creative in taking picture from the would-have-been impossible angles.What I don't care much...- The build quality is not that perfect... kind of plastic, which I am afraid if one day I simply throw it into my backpack and it bumps with all other stuff it's gonna break!.- If you decide to use it.... an external flash (like FL36R) is out of consideration, because you need the hotshoe for this (except you use the RC mode).- My E-PL1 is in silver, but this VF2 I got is black... it goes together well, not that bad. (Actually I wan that silver version, but again... what's the point to pay $30 more for just a color change????)What I hate...- Man!..... price, price, price!!! Pay $240! for this piece of plastic and small high resolution display inside... I think it's kind of ridiculous. Olympus should consider (for its future accessories, at least) to price its product more reasonable than this thing.Bottom line: if you don't know how to use your tax-return money... this one is a good buy!!! I guarantee you will love it like I do. However, if you are okay with taking picture without the VF (for example, no problem with shaky-hands, or not so much shooting in the direct sunlight)... you can use your hard-earn money in many -- a bit more clever -- ways... like save a bit more and go for new lens, or a good external flash at this same price point (FL36R is just $200 when I bought it)."}

{"reviewerID":"AKD82ANEXCI2D","reviewText":"Not to jump on a soapbox, but I have been building computers for fun and profit over the last 20 years, and I have NEVER had so many problems with a motherboard and subsequent HORRIFIC support.When I first installed the board I updated to the latest F3 Bios and loaded the optimized defaults.  Windows 7 installed without issue, but when I shut down the machine it wouldn't power up again.  I had to unplug the power cord, wait 30 seconds, and then plug it back in order to get the machine to boot. I assumed I had a bad PSU, so I tested the voltages and when i wasn't convinced I swapped it for another unit that worked.  Same problem. I thought there may be a grounding issue, so I removed all the components and the board and reinstalled it. Same problem. I took out the video card and used the on-board graphics. Same problem. Reset the memory timing to 1600 instead of 2400. Same problem. Maybe it's a problem with the case power\/reset switches so i disconnected them and used the on-board switches.  I tried everything possible but still had the same problem.Finally, I contact Gigabyte support and in my initial message explained in, detail everything, that I had already done in troubleshooting the board.  Their response was to ignore everything that I had already done and start over from the beginning. I understand that they need to make sure each potential external issue is addressed before replacing a motherboard, but I had already spent 3 days off and on testing and troubleshooting ALL of the brand new components I had just purchased from Amazon for this rig. To be run around in circles redoing what I had already done and documented to them was MADDENING!So while I was waiting for Gigabyte support to decide on the next basic troubleshooting step, I started configuring Windows7 and I discover that the Thunderbolts ports won't correctly recognize any of my Thunderbolt external drives.  Neither my Seagate or Lacie drives work. I also tried using my secondary monitor, but it doesn't work either.Maybe I received a bad board and you will have better luck, but I suggest you seriously think twice before buying this motherboard. This is the LAST Gigabyte board I'll ever buy for myself or for a customer."}
{"reviewerID":"A3SUB6GEFZPASD","reviewText":"My original review:I would like to give this a 3.5 stars instead of 3, because it is better than \"OK\", but there are some things that keep me from really \"liking\" it. Also, I have held off on writing this review for about 5 months since I always want to use an item quite a bit before I review its function.The things I like:1. This is a good tripod that can be had for a little over a hundred dollars depending on the time of sale.2. The ball head on this one is a lot better than the head on the ZX600B103 - its my favorite part of this tripod.3. Overall, the tripod is pretty sturdy with the carbon fiber legs and is not all that heavy when hiking around with it.4. I use the carrying case all the time, so that is a great plus as well.5. I love being able to loosen all the legs at once, and feel that the smoother profile of the twist locks is more my style than the lever locks.6. the counter weight hook is very useful for windy or precarious scenarios (just be sure to have the weighted object sit on the ground; do not let it hang in the wind or it will sway the tripod with it!)7. Good \"bang for buck\"The quirks:1. The tightening knob on the quick release was very stiff and was very close to the bottom of my camera, making it hard to secure using my fingers. That said, I pulled it apart and yanked out the springs in it (that are surprisingly stiff!) and put it back together with no springs and it worked much better to secure it. More recently, I replaced them with some much softer springs from a clicky-pen which is perfect now.2. The plate that secures the quick release would catch a little with tightening it, so I added a little bit of grease to that, and with the softer springs it works amazing.3. The tension on the screws holding the legs in place need constant adjusting. I think I might put a little thread lock on them to keep them in place once I find a sweet spot for tension4. After setting the ball head at an angle, it tends to sag quite a bit warranting adjustment. This is expected for a ball head in this price range, so is far from a deal breaker.The things I don't like (note that all of them surround the center column):1. The images online show a short column, which this does not have. I almost returned it just for that alone, since I was banking on the short center column. I don't really see the point of having the legs go parallel to the ground if the center column is so long that it cant be lowered all the way. This prevents the tripod from going down to ground level. I am bummed because the image on Amazon is not true to the function of the tripod (shows a short column option).2. The center column is made such that the twist lock needs to be extremely tight to prevent the center column from having a lot of rotational slop to it (it holds vertically just fine). The reason for this is that the center column uses a tongue and groove mechanism with the groove is on the center column and the tongue is on the tripod base. The problem is that the tongue is much narrower than the width of the groove leaving a lot of rotational slop. I figured I could get around this by just tightening the twist locker on the center column, but even with the twist lock extremely tight, I can still rotate the whole center column with relative ease. This means that If I want to keep the image fixed on one point, I have to be very careful not to bump the camera so that the center column does not rotate inside the base of the tripod. Its hard to explain, and is a lot more of a pain than I imagined it would be... Could be a problem with just my copy though.Update - up to 4 starsI contacted Amazon regarding the lack of short center column and they offered me a $20 rebate since it did not come with one (yet was advertised in the pics). I will be buying a new center column from Dolica and shorten it so that I can have a short center column as well. This customer service has beenUpdate 2 (6\/1\/2014) - down to 3 starsOne of the legs has fallen off. Looks like the glue that holds the ring-lock fastener to the carbon fiber portion has failed. I would have dropped the rating down to 2 stars, but Dolica was prompt with their shipment of a new leg to replace it. That said, I am quite disappointed that the leg has failed so soon. I really wanted to like this tripod given the great price. However, even at a low price it cannot work for me if one of the legs is broken. Looks like I will be selling this tripod and taking a loss. I just want something a bit more reliable for those times that I need my tripod to work for me. For those weekend warriors with light gear, this would be a valuable tool, I am sure!"}

The sound quality, however, is not equal.  It is not horrible either.  I am NOT an audiophile, but could discern a difference in sound level and quality between the two.I had no problems wearing these on a cross-country flight (NH - CA with one stop).  I wore them for the entire flight (each leg) and they were very comfortable.  I slept well with them on too (they didn't prevent me from sleeping).The Monitor button on the Left ear cup on the Sony is great.  You don't have to remove the headphones while on the plane to hear the Stewardess ask if you want that teeny tiny bag of chex.In short, if you ARE an audiophile and simply cannot skimp on sound quality (and don't care about the price) go with the Bose.

Sony TV's in my book are across the board the best blend of top technology, proven durability and quality as well as sleek cool looks.  My family has always owned Sony TV's and have never had even one of them serviced, some still running are over 20 years old!But back to my new KDL-40S3000..... It's a sure crowd pleaser in any home!  As of now, there are no HD broadcast channels in the 1080p format, only 1080i  which this TV with the native resolution of 720p displays vividly, so I would advise you to think about this if you are looking at some of Sony's 1080p models that cost a lot more.  Along with the fact that because the majority of broadcast channels besides HD channels (1080i) on Digital cable and I believe even Satellite are still in the 480p format, a TV such as this one with 720p resolution will display a cleaner and sharper image than that of a 1080p model. Bottom line... unless you have a Blu-Ray or HD DVD player and want a barely noticeable sharper picture, Go With 720p, you will save money and not be sacrificing anything trust me!As for features and sound quality, you will be overwhelmed with what Sony brings to the plate.  The menu options and settings are extensive but yet fun with Sony's graphical onscreen display, but the picture right of the box is just as impressive. I am a big fan of surround sound systems, but so far I am completely satisfied with the KDL-40S3000's clear and projecting sound quality, and I seriously question the poor remarks from other reviews about this set being deficient in sound.  The audio\/video inputs and outputs of this set are numerous and the 2 HDMI hook-ups will meet the needs of most home users considering there are also 2 component connections and various other lower quality connections.So in closing I would recommend the Sony KDL-40S3000 to any and everyone looking to get into the flat-panel market, hands-down!!! Yes, Sony may be a bit more money than comparable sized other brands, but you are paying for top notch quality, engineering, and styling and you will not regret a cent of it! Set your price range, determine the right size and viewing distance for your room and put Sony at the top of your list when shopping Amazon.com for the best price on your flat-panel TV! Good luck and I hope my review has helped. I know a flat-panel is a major purchase and it's worth the time and effort to write a review if you are truly impressed and satisfied to pass on a great experience to others!"}

A lot of people says that those issues are now fixed in the newest update of Android 4.3. Also in this new update includes multiuser.The first issue that i found is that sometimes the screen gets unresponsive but you can fix it, turning off the screen and turning it on again. after that it will get responsive again.Second issue: After you put the screen in sleep mode, when you turn it on again 2 skinny lines appears, i was thiking that those lines are like bad pixels or something but they only appears after you put the screen in sleep mode. those lines are veeeeery skinny you can notice it with some colors, for example if in this time the screen has a green color the skinny line will appers with a lighting blue color.note: you can only notice those lines in landscape mode because when is portrait mode the lines are on the botton and i dont know why the lines doesnt appears.EXAMPLES:After Sleep[...]Before Sleep[...]PROS:- Very responsive- Ultra Fast- 0 Lags- 8 Inch of screen, perfect for pdf and read at home. (during the sunlight is not so good, but for movies is perfect)- Clean Android- SD SLOT!

It work ok, but the digital sounds were not coming in clearly, meaning the sounds would be interrupted when I use my home theater surround sound system with the fiber optics cable. I then use this amplifier and the digital sounds were crisp with no more sound interruptions.I bought this because I was planning to move my TV to other side of the room. I bought a new Monster THXV100F50 THX Certified Coaxial Video Cable (50 feet)because that's how much I needed. I connect this cable from the splitter to the amplifier and lost 50% of my digital channels. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Is the cable too long? I don't know.

{"reviewerID":"A2Q1KMJZLBC4XV","reviewText":"I received the lens earlier today so I haven't had time to do extensive testing yet, but I'm pretty happy with it so far. I should start by saying that I really wanted an ultra wide fast prime lens. I used to only use primes and still prefer them, but I have started using zooms because of the convenience of not needing to carry and change lenses.Before ordering I also looked at the canon 14mm 2.8L and Tokina 14 2.8, buts didn't want to pay around 2,000 for the canon and read several reviews about the Tokina getting dust inside. Finally opted to go with the 17-40L because I do have a 24mm prime and of lesser importance to me but worth considering, the Tokina won't take filters.I used my full frame 5d to test the lens, haven't tried it on an aps-c sensor yet but probably will just to see how it compares later. On the 5d the corners are a little soft wide open, but not too bad and after stopping down I didn't really notice any softness. There is also a little distortion at 17 but also nothing I can not live with. I plan to mostly use this for landscape photography and interesting effects, so stopping down isn't a problem for me. Not sure how it would work for large group shots yet.Bottom line: From what I have seen so far this is a pretty good lens for the price. If you need super fast and sharp I would go with a prime or maybe 16-35mm 2.8L. If you don't need to shoot in low light or can't afford the 16-35 2.8 this is a good option. I gave it 4 stars because its not as fast as I would ideally want."}

He took some sample pictures with them normally, outside of water (where you would expect much better performance).  The pictures were so shaky and blurred, that I could barely recognize what they were an image of.  I tried myself, holding the mask steady and taking a pic like a normal camera.  Again, so much camera shake that the image was insulting.  I haven't shown my sone yet, because as forgiving as he is, even he will recognize that the camera is trash.The 3MP isn't a big deal for an 8 year old, and has nothing to do with the image quality hear.  What I saw was undeniable a horrible camera-shake issue, even though the camera was held reasonably still.The cheapest water-proof camera will yield results that are worlds better than this (though the will cost more).

{"reviewerID":"A36I5QI57MCF93","reviewText":"After spending 3 weeks with my Wacom Intuos4 tablet, I feel ready to write about my experiences using it.The Intuos4 is the 4th tablet I've owned from Wacom: My first being the ArtZ model, followed by an Intuos, then Intuos3. I upgraded to the Intuos3 shortly after it was announced, and made a similar move with the Intuos4.The Intuos4 comes in small, medium, large and x-large sizes. Being that I don't work on overly large canvases or draw with broad strokes, I ruled out the larger two models. For me, the medium size is the right fit.Included in the box are a stylus, a USB cable, the tablet itself, a stylus holder (with 10 pen tips), a mouse, and a CD. I didn't take any unboxing photos, but there are enough of those found on the web already. But I will say this, the unboxing experience was very Apple-esque. If you've ever opened a box for a Mac, you'll know what I mean.Installation was straight-forward: First, simply plug one end of the USB cable to the tablet and attach the other end to the computer. Then, install the driver software.I had problems installing the driver software from the supplied disc, so I wound up downloading them from Wacom's site. This was about the only \"niggle\" I had with the out-of-box experience.The best thing about the Intuos4 is the feel of the surface and its pressure-sensitivity. The Intuos3 boasted 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity, while the Intuos4 has double that amount. Also new with the Intuos4 are the LED buttons on the tablet and a scroll wheel, reminiscent of the iPod. The LED buttons display the appropriate keyboard button (Shift, Cmd, Option, etc.), which can also be reassigned as the user sees fit.When using the Intuos3 tablet, I found myself disabling the buttons on the right-hand side because they got in the way. Thankfully, with Intuos4 can be used with the buttons on the left or right hand side, depending upon whether you are right or left-handed. For me, a righty, the buttons are oriented on the left, out of harm's way.The tablet itself works very, very well. Gone is the plastic shield overlay from the previous Intuos models. The plastic overlay was mildly annoying because if your hand perspires, the surface can quickly become sticky. The Intuos4 model's surface has more `tooth' to it, while similarly allowing for fluid movement. The tablet is VERY sensitive (in a good way). I did not need to bear down on the stylus as much as I would have had to with the previous tablet. Not that I press the stylus down very hard to begin with, but the sensitivity of the Intuos4 makes it to where I don't need to press down on it as much as I did before.The stylus itself is slightly smaller, but fits very well in my hands. On the top of the stylus is an eraser, and on the side of the barrel is a click-button, which you can assign to a specific function.Drawing with the Intuos4 is a true pleasure. I'm very happy with my purchase.The obvious question I've been asked is: why not get a Wacom Cintiq instead? The Cintiq still holds a place in my artistic heart, but I'm not ready for the added expense. (Cintiq's start at $999, and the Intuos4 model I purchase clocks in at roughly $340.) At some point I will own a Cintiq as well, when the form factor is improved. What I like about the Intuos vs the Cintiq (even the 12' model) is the portability factor. I can take this tablet with me anywhere, with minimal fuss.Using a tablet takes some getting used to, especially if you've never drawn on one before. If you're new to drawing on a tablet, or are especially budget conscious, my recommendation would be to purchase a Wacom Graphire Bamboo tablet instead.If you have an Intuos3, do you NEED an Intuos4? If you use one on a regular basis, and appreciate the nuances of the Intuos line, then I would say YES. There is a substantial difference between the two model lines. You will notice it when you draw on the tablet's surface. If you have a Graphire Bamboo and are considering an upgrade, the Intuos4 is an excellent step-up.Just like the Intuos3, I know I will be using this for a very long time. Highly Recommended."}

After reading all of the reviews of the Cotton Carrier I decided to go the cheaper route and purchase a knockoff from Amazon. After using the cheaper vest system for a few weeks I returned it to Amazon as it was uncomfortable (I'm 5'11&#34; and weight 215 lbs.) to wear, especially on my chest and shoulders. I also noticed the cheaper clone didn't offer the 10 degree angled camera hub that comes with the Cotton Carrier. While wearing the cheaper vest and walking around with a Nikon D600 with a 70-200mm attached to it on my chest, it pulled the vest away from my body and put extra pressure on the top of my shoulders.Amazon was great and allowed me to return the cheap clone so I could purchase the Cotton Carrier.As mentioned, the fit is much better, the 10 degree angled hubs make a huge difference on how the lens fits and sits against the front of my body while walking\/hiking with it. The quality is outstanding and so far I haven't had any issues with the Cotton Carrier at all.One note I would like to add is that the shoulder straps have no padding in them. While wearing with a jacket, this isn't a problem but when walking 5-10 miles with a heavy lens (300mm F2.8) I can feel it on the top of my shoulders when just wearing a t-shirt. That would be my only improvement suggestion to the manufacture."}

Well, turns out I love the puck. The phone rings and I tap the puck for mute. So easy. And fine adjustment is precise, with little effort.Regarding sound, I haven't heard the Cinemate GS, but I can say the Companion 5 speakers rock. Chrystal clear, with nice tones in mid range and bass as well. That said, they do fall a tad short when compared to high-end cabinet speakers. No surprise, and I only mention it because there are Bose-philes who argue otherwise. The notes of great cabinet speakers I find to be richer, fuller, rounder, and they resonate in my whole body. Easier on the ears too.But this is a mini system, it's a Bose system, and it's fantastic. The audio imaging is remarkable, with separation of vocals, strings, woodwind, percussion, etc. And with plenty of reserve power for an explosive crescendo or dramatic flourish, without a nano second of turbo lag. It's a big sound that fills the air, highly versatile for whatever you listen to. With the sub woof under my desk and the little speakers up front and center, it's a minimalist rig, as needs be in an office setting. And in fairness, this sound also resonates for me.It's brought fun and pleasure into my office. I'm thrilled. Sometimes when you hunt and peck on Amazon, it leads you somewhere unexpected and marvelous. Just a few clicks, and a few days later I find myself transported to a magical sound garden."}

It seems that this is Wenger's largest laptop bag for 17 inch widescreen laptops?  I read review after review of other models that fit \"most\" 17\" laptops but were very tight or just wouldn't close with 17\" widescreen laptop.  I would definitely recommend this bag.  I believe I paid about $60, but heard of a Best Buy \"steal\" back earlier in the year where they went for $15!  Wished I could've known back then as the bag retails in BB for $100 now."}
{"reviewerID":"AH79X9T2G9XSI","reviewText":"This is a horrible idea for many reasons, and I'll explain why...This film was introduced some years back (I'm writing in 2010) to allow amateur photographers to shoot black and white and have it developed at their local labs.  The problem is that by the time this product was introduced to the market, a majority of labs had converted to a mixed digital exposure\/chemical process for their printing.  This means that the effect this film achieves can be reproduced by many labs with the press of a button.If a person shoots this film, they will get black and white images.  That's it.If a person shoots color film, a digital hybrid lab can give them either digital OR color.  Color information is preserved for later use if not desired initially.  In effect, regular color film will do what this film does AND give you color images too, if you desire so, later.This product will ONLY GIVE YOU BLACK AND WHITE!  For ever.  And ever.And it is NOT the quality of true black and white film, so there's not advantage there.  This film relies on the same effect that standard color film does--the information is stored in dye blooms which are much larger than the silver grains of traditional black and white films.  The end result is that this film has a different grain structure than traditional black and white films.  It appears to have little grain, but it is in effect lower resolution than true black and white films.If you want black and white done at your local lab, just ask them to make your prints black and white.  If they don't know how, get a new lab.If you want real black and white images, shoot real black and white film and process it yourself.  It's a wonderful experience!  Your film and images will outlast your grandkids!  Not so with this modern Frankenstein process.This product is a marketing ploy just like APS.  Don't fall for it!  Kodak still makes wonderful black and white films (Tri-X, TMAX, PlusX), which I would highly recommend instead of this crappy film.  There are plenty of college kids around who can process it for you or show you how.And finally, yes, I have used this product.  I tried it.  I wanted to like it.  I thought, hey, it's a great way to let people try black and white photography.  But it's not.  It's just a bad idea.  Like APS film, it's just a marketing gimmick with no real value or technical advantage.  It's targeted at people who don't know any better.Hopefully some of you attracted to this film will read this, and then you'll know better.Good luck in your photography.  After reading this, get some other film, or any camera really, and go shoot!  Enjoy!"}

{"reviewerID":"AWFYD0JLWL6DG","reviewText":"This is the coolest little record player ever.  Its works fine as a regular record player and the software is easy to use when you want to convert your old records into electronic files.One thing to note is that if you plug in the USB cable you must have the software installed and open to get the player to work.  At first I thought it was broken because it wouldn't spin up.  But then I realized that the software has a built-in awareness of the &#34;start and stop&#34; of the player and to a certain extent the player can be controlled through the software. Hense if you plug in the USB the player waits for commands from the software.If you want to just listen to the player it has a built in speaker that will take you back in time.  It's pretty good for a basic player, but if you are an audiophile, you will want to plug in an external speaker.  I loved the design of the case and my only complaint is that they didn't allow any extra room inside the case to put the power cable when you box it back up.  It will fit if you are creative, but be careful not to crimp anything or push down too hard on the platter.Dig out those old vinyl records people and harken back to yesteryear!"}
{"reviewerID":"A3DQKTQVK7ZCCD","reviewText":"My goal was to build the absolute smallest AND cheapest UBUNTU 12.10 64 bit HTPC\/Web Browser box possible.I placed this mini ITX computer case in my cart (along with everything else for this build) and waited till the price came down on this case to 40bucks, yes 40 dollars, before I purchased everything.....INCLUDING:a $50 mini ITX main board from ECS Elitegroup w\/ HDMI output.a $45 INTEL G540 Celeron Processor. (It has onboard HD graphics)8 gigs of Kingston RAM. (I swapped out 4gigRAM from another PC and used it for this build. The 8gigs went into the other PC.)And a $12 16GB Cruzer FIT USB Flash Drive (I made it bootable and used it instead of a HDD or SSD for loading UBUNTU and some other freeware.)Everything here came in just under 200 bucks!!! (after adjusting for the price of the RAM)As for the case:The price is SUPER LOW!!! And it comes with a power supply (200 Watts) that's amazingly quite even when its fan is spinning. This is the quietest PC I think I've ever built. It's suited for HTPC use in this regard. Any shortcomings this case has from this point on are purely based on how (inexpensive) cheap it is, and...... Man, is it pretty cheap.The front panel is made of cheap plastic. It just screams CHEAP!There's one open slot for an Optical Drive that's hidden behind a flimsy flip-down door, and one open slot for another USB header or whatever you want there, and it has a another USB header hidden behind a flimsy push-and-click-open style flip-down door which holds 2 USB ports, and MIC and Headphone jacks. These flimsy doors make the case seem pretty cheap.And there is a Power ON\/OFF button. I thought that it was rotated 90 degrees off to the 3 o'clock position, but from the pictures here on Amazon, this is the true position. CHEAP!It does not come with a reset button. But, did I tell you how cheap this case is?Here's where things go askew ..... The POWER ON LED light that surrounds the power button did not work on this case. I thought that I hooked up those tiny little power pins wrong on the motherboard, but it turns out that when I hook up the HDD LED it worked. Since I do not have a HDD, this was not a big deal. So now the HDD LED is actually the POWER ON LED on this case. CHEAP!! The LED lights are glued into place and I can't replace them easily without tearing things up. So, there are some QC problems going on with this case. BUT, did I tell you how CHEAP this case is?It is true from the other reviews that the INTEL FAN that comes with the Processor barely misses the bottom of the power supply. I had to bend the power supply up using quite a bit of force before I could get the fan, processor, and the motherboard to fit underneath it.I fear that the flip-down door that hides the USB ports is gonna break after some heavy use. Other reviewers haves stated this, too.BUT, did I tell how cheap this case is??I'm still giving it four stars, because the price is RIGHT!! It's not an ugly case, really; it's just CHEAP!.I suggest that folks who can tinker around with things only buy this case; folks who are not afraid to \"adjust\" things to get it to work, if you get my meaning. Those who want better quality should look elsewhere. But, for me, I still enjoyed building this PC -- warts and all."}

{"reviewerID":"A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW","reviewText":"I had been using a Linksys\/Cisco wireless router with dual channel capabilities that I use as a wireless access point.  I jumped at the chance to try out the latest technology, including Wireless AC.  This D-Link router performs just as well with our smartphones and desktop computers in the Wireless N band; however, we don't have any devices yet that would take full advantage of the Wireless AC standards.I have the router set as a dedicated access point -- we have FIOS service and use the Verizon device as the router, but we turn off the wireless on the Verizon router and assign an IP address to the access point.  That keeps the routers from going to war with one another.We get good reception throughout the house, including in a room where the computer sits against a wall that contains a wire screen on which bathroom tile is mounted (death for wireless signals).  There are no problems here with the strength of the signal over distance or with dropped connections.Overall, the device is easy to set up.  I did not use the D-Link software or app to control the router and cannot comment on them.  I find most software written for routers and access cards to cause problems.  In my experience, it's usually best to follow the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid).Overall, this is a good router that's relatively future-proof.  Well worth looking into."}

{"reviewerID":"A3VFWX3FJXRJ7J","reviewText":"Wired connections work very well, but wireless will disconnect almost daily and then not reconnect until you reset the router. After that your computer\/video equipment may connect, but then not get access to the Internet.  Search the Internet for posting during the last 1-2 months and you will see that this is a very common issue and NETGEAR has not been able to fix it so people are switching to Linksys list the E4200. The lastest version of the firmware is much worse than the previous version, so if you already ordered this unit then don't upgrade unless a new version comes out after the date of this review (August 14, 2011).Another issue if you are planning to use two of these routers in a Bridged mode. NETGEAR forces you to turn off wireless security and then rely only on Mac Address security, which is a security hole. It does not stop users from monitoring your data and acting like they are your other router.You will also notice that a common complaint is weak signal. The internal antenna's are not good enough and you can't add externals. This unit is not able to fully cover a 2-story house. My old Linksys did, and I have a new Motorola cable modem that my TIVO and Blu-Ray player are connecting to fine, whereas the NETGEAR caused video pauses.I did not see these same problems on the N600, but watch out if NETGEAR upgrades that firmware.  Don't be the first to use it."}

However, when connected to a television, the remote control performs many other functions (I knew this before purchasing).I have read some reviews where the user has difficulties getting the remote to do anything with the Sony A57; hopefully, this helps because it's actually very easy:1) Press the \"Fn\" Button2) Scroll to Drive Mode (On the A57 it is the topmost icon on the left)3) Press the \"AF\" button (This acts as an \"Ok\" button)4) Scroll all the way to the bottom and you should see an icon that looks like a remote control.5) Press the \"AF\" buttonThis should allow the remote to communicate with the camera.NOTE: The remote control DOES work when the A57 is set to BULB! (on the A57, the BULB setting is only available when the Camera is in Manual Mode).

{"reviewerID":"A2573BWPH7TVE","reviewText":"I was seriously considering getting the Bose SoundDock; my friend has it and sounds great. It's obvious problem is portability and since I travel a lot the Bose was not the most practical option. I was about to buy the JBL On-Stage until I came across the Logitech MM50. Apparently JBL had to recall some of their speakers and that does not augur well for the image of the product even if they claim they have solved the problem.The mm50 is a well-designed, well thought-out product. Right out of the box, there is a black carrying case in which the speakers and its remote easily fit. I've found that on most products the battery life is over-stated. Surprisingly, this is not the case with the mm50. Besides the battery (which the Bose and JBL lack) makes this a winner.But of-course, the key factor is sound. Admittedly, the sound is not as good as the Bose. My collection of Bach and Mozart is rather limited - if you listen exclusively or mostly to classical music, perhaps you can sacrifice the portability and get the Bose or even the new Klipsch. The sound is clear and for such a small set of speakers really loud. Both my immediate neighbours have asked me to stop playing music at 5 am.For this price, I was kind of surprised to find a remote. The remote is strictly serviceable and by no means cutting-edge. They seem to have placed the sensor in a not-so-smart position. Perhaps they added the remote as an after-thought.Of course, it also charges the Ipod and you can sync it directly with the PC through the speakers itself. Another nice touch is the ability of add another music player if you want - like ur DiscMan or another MP3 player. The cables for these are not provided, but you can get a regular line in cable for like 2 bucks at a RadioShack.It also came with all sorts of holders to make sure your Ipod fits in - I have a 3G and a 5G Video - and have tried a friend's Ipod Mini. All fit and work correctly. I am pretty sure the Nano also works - but that should be double-checked.On the cons side - while it does look cool, it is not as uber as the Klipsch and the Bose. I personally never liked the way the On-stage looked (seemed a bit corny) but that is relative to one's tastes."}

{"reviewerID":"A3OA4DV4L81N1D","reviewText":"APPEARANCE: The Domke F-5XC espouses traditional materials and no nonsense design. The cotton canvas, plain woven strap, black metal fasteners and spartan design pulse with an army medic bag vibe. Fit and finish are excellent with no loose threads or skewed seams. And proudly made in the USA!The F-5XC will not win fashion kudos but is about being inconspicuous, perfect for minimalist street shooters. Stylistically it is well matched with a destructed leather or demin jacket and won't get a second look on the street. If being inconspicuous is important, remove the red Domke logo from the front flap.Unlike an army medic bag, the outer canvas is flexible, the inside lining is soft and the bottom reinforced with a rigid platform for support and shock absorption. The sides of the bag have thin foam padding between the lining and outer canvas. The top flap has no padding. Thin padding leaves room for surprising capacity within a slim profile. The downside is there is minimal protection from impact.Velcro secures the main flap. Not my favorite fastener and this one is giganormous: difficult to open and noisy. A leather and brass latch would be a more elegant solution.USING THE F-5XC: \"Large Shoulder Bag\" is a misnomer as, while it is a shoulder bag, it isn't large. It's small and best suited for a compact system, e.g., Micro 4\/3 or medium DSLR without battery grip. The F-5XC has two tall dividers\/pillars with padded \"wings\" on top. The dividers are strong enough to support a DSLR with mounted lens, but are sectioned so they can be bent to partition the compartment into two levels, with the lower level accessed via the zippered trapdoor on the front. I use the compartment full length with one divider fully extended to store a lens on the left side (an EF 70-200 2.8L USM fits with hood reversed). The upper end of the other divider is bent over to the right as a platform for a camera with mounted lens. The dividers are semi-rigid and have Velcro in every possible place, so they will not move while your gear is stowed.The F-5XC swallowed my EOS 5D MKII with mounted EF 70-200 4L IS USM with plenty of room for another medium sized lens and large shoe flash. Yes, that was pushing it but the flap closed fine and there were no bulges. Due to the lack of padding, there is more room inside than it appears. Nevertheless, gripped DLSRs and pro models, e.g., EOS 1D series, don't fit.GOTCHAS: With an EOS 5D MKII and 24-105 4L IS USM inside, the 1.5 inch strap bites into my shoulder like an angry dog. A thin strap is fine for M4\/3 cameras but a wider strap and\/or shoulder pad are needed for a DSLR. If you carry a DSLR, expect to pony up $20-30 for a wider strap and\/or shoulder pad. I added the Billingham SP-15 shoulder pad and it's more comfortable and grippy than the stock strap. It also matches the vintage vibe of the bag. If you prefer to stay pure Domke, you can buy a matching Domke 2-inch Gripper Strap (black) from major photo gear retailers.The F-5XC lacks a grab handle. This omission bothered me so much I rigged up a handle by sewing Timbuk2 cross-strap hooks to a handle I removed from an old Tamrac bag. Works great! Domke makes a handle replacement for their J series bags but it is too long for this bag.A lack of pockets for accessories is this bag's greatest shortcoming. There is no zippered inner pocket to stash your wallet or passport and the two tiny front pockets are almost completely useless. The front pockets wouldn't bother me much if I could add a pouch for my iPhone or sun glasses but there is no provision for side mount accessories.This Amazon product listing is for two different Domke bag models: F-5XC and F5ZX. The reviews confuse matters more by averaging bag scores. Yes, these bags have a similar shape, but sport different interiors sizes and features. For example, the F-5ZX (brown Waxwear) has shorter and more flimsy dividers and lacks the lower trapdoor opening. It's also stiffer and more difficult to get gear in and out. Unfortunately, Amazon has not provided images of the differing features--especially interiors--so you're on your own. Google the model and look at pictures on other sites. I briefly owned the F-5ZX (brown Waxwear) but returned it to Amazon.FINAL BLURB: This is my first Domke bag and it revealed an excellent fit and finish, quality materials and a classic albeit spartan design ethic. Yes, it is pricey but has surprisingly ample storage in a small space. The soft cotton canvas molds to your body thereby taking some weight off the shoulder. Even loaded with a 5D MKII and EF 70-200 4L IS USM I found it comfortable to hump around town all day, provided I wear it sling style with a shoulder pad. The cotton canvas is easy on clothing and does not \"sand\" delicate fabrics like ballistic nylon used in other bags. I often reach for this bag first, finding it ideal for casual shooting around town.I posted images of my Domke F-5XC (black) in the user image area."}

Wilson, but due to my location, and my neighbors 100' tall Eucalyptus trees, we do not have direct line of sight with the broadcast towers. In1988, prior to digital broadcasts, there was a very large antenna on a 10' mast fastened to the roof but it only managed to receive a few channels and those channels had ghosts and snow. Our solution at that time was to remove the antenna and purchase cable programing. Then in 2005 we switched to equally expensive satellite TV.As television providers got greedier and greedier, prices keep rising for their services and programming becomes less and less interesting with more and more advertisements. I clocked it with a stopwatch once and in an hours worth of programming there was just about 1\/2 an hour of content, sometimes even less.Finally we had enough. When I retired in 2007 I was no longer willing to pay $70 a month for basic satellite fees to watch what I call &#34;Commercialvision&#34;. We decided to switch back to an antenna hoping to get a couple of the basic TV channels for local news and rely on Netflix and Amazon for our movie entertainment.I tried several different antennas including a Bow-tie looking one and an old VHF antenna I purchased at a yard sale, but none produced more than 3 channels. Then an electrical engineering friend of mine made a couple of directional antennas that we elevated on a 15 foot mast and rotated while watching a signal strength meter, but the most we got for all his efforts was again three channels, 7, 9 and sometimes 11 or 13&#8230;.. So he made me a simple bi-pole antenna which we stapled to the rafters inside my attic and gave up, settling for three channels (its worth noting that reception would vary from night to day and night to night.The only channel I could consistently receive was the one I disliked the most, channel 7 (In my opinion channel 7, Disney owned ABC, has the least content and the most commercials of all the channels. Setting aside my dislike of anything owned by the greedy Disney corporation, it is channels 2, 4, 11 that broadcasts most of the football games, something I have not been able to watch for way too long). It was time to try something else&#8230;&#8230; I started to look at antennas again.In my research, I read the reviews on this antenna on Amazon, and thought I would give it a try. So yesterday a friend of mine and I crawled up in the attic, unfolded this antenna, pointed it in the general direction of Mt. Wilson, turned the TV on, and found I now received a total of 40 channels. Admit tingly, most of which I will never watch including Korean, Spanish, Russian, Armenian and several religious programs, but I now get channels 2, 4, 7.1, 7.2, 9, 11, and the 13's (all 3 of those).I could not be happier, and that is the reason I am taking the time to write this review&#8230; I'm hoping it encourages others to try this antenna&#8230;.. it is definitely tuned for digital reception."}

My other complaint is some of the buttons on the keyboard have an odd profile. The ESC and function keys are embedded into the keyboard and don't stick out like the rest of the keys. This makes them feel odd for touch typists who are used to reaching for the corner to hit ESC."}

It links so easy to my cell phone.  Works Great!!!!  I even use it in my car and truck because it works so easy.Love this little box.  There is a little red light that come on when you plug in to charge it and goes off when charged.The only problem I have had is, I need to leave off the battery cover or it won't work.  The cover pushes on the battery and makes it disconnect.  They know the problem exists.  Amazon should not sell products that have problems that are know.  I had read it in several review before I had purchase the speaker.  I am going to try to fix it."}

{"reviewerID":"AOZ3HKOR7M1VS","reviewText":"This is a fantastic device that any small business owner or home owner should install in conjunction with a good UPS. Even if your UPS says it has power conditioning get this. It will do a much better job and the part that actually bleeds off spikes in power will last longer. The ones in your typical store bought, or even nice UPS, units will wear out in a year or so depending on your situation and you will never know that your device is getting constant fluctuations. This is what kills and or causes people to replace electronics all the time. They almost always think they have bad electronics when in fact they just have bad maintenance habits caused by simple ignorance of the problems you must address in regards to your home\/business power supply. If you have power that fluctuates in your environs you are literally cutting the life of your computers, televisions and more in half or worse. With computers many of the problems you see in regards to slowing down and constant little hardware failures (Hard Drives being a big one) are caused by this. Buy one of these and a good UPS for your new big screen and you will have it for 8 years instead of 4 before it needs replacing. That kind of savings right there would buy you enough of these to protect all your electronics.However there seem to be some who do not understand what this is and think it will also apply power to your line.. It will not provide your device with additional power when a device peals off a large spike in current. It will just protect the device from the harm that can be caused by the irregular voltage that happens with such an occurrence. When you see that pull that lowers the power through out your home you may not notice the large spike and extreme lows and spikes that occur through out the event. This protects you from that. If you want to insure compensating power is provided you need to add a UPS as well. Hope this helps....Keep this device because it will save your electronics since you obviously need to increase the capacity of the feed and wiring in your home. I just moved into an old home last year that had the most cobbled together electrical system I had ever seen. I was told that is pretty normal in the old days. I have a huge number of very valuable electronics so I paid $8,000 to have new mains brought to the house and isolated new circuits through out the house where ever electronics would go. Even then I had brown outs when my A\/C cut on. I had a house surge protector installed at the circuit box, a special power compensation unit added to the A\/C and have put these devices and APC 1500 UPS's through out the house to guarantee smooth power no matter the problem. It may seem extreme but compared to replacing equipment or God forbid making a claim that would cost me several times that improvement cost in increased premiums. Pay the money and do it right or regret it later.This is one of those situation where it is not a matter of \"If\". It is a matter of \"It is happening right now as you read this review\". Buy it now. It is cheaper than a night at the movies for the family.Jeff"}

{"reviewerID":"A3E100XIZXJ6GS","reviewText":"First of all, I received this hard drive for free during promotion time other internet store had - with a purchase of Sony Tablet S - it was a great deal! So, my review is not that open (price factor was never counted).I think it's a great idea to watch movies on the tablet during traveling using this wireless hard drive. The whole idea of wireless hard drive was so new and unique for me, so I was a little skeptical at first. I didn't know what to expect... I didn't downloaded suggested apps (just connected to the hard drive and opened browser to access needed folders). So far everything works great! However I have few issues that might not even be related to this device itself:1) I downloaded the app from android market that allows me to watch movies in many different formats (my tablet doesn't support all of them), and it's working, but very... very slow... I don't think this hard drive has anything to do with this problem to be honest, but I think it worse to mention.2) The battery life is not long enough (in my opinion), but at least there is an option to charge this device through usb outlet or car charger. I love it!3) I don't know if I will be able to use this wireless hard drive during my long transatlantic trips... I couldn't get straight answer as if Delta (for example) would allow usage of wireless devices during 10-hour flights. My research shows that there are a lot of different opinions from \"yes, you might use it when you are above certain altitude\" to \"no, it simply wouldn't work while you are inside the airplane\".Other than that I just love this little device and the whole idea of wifi connection to it!"}
{"reviewerID":"AMXRJGQGJJDV7","reviewText":"I went with this LG 47LM6200 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses to replace my Samsung PN50C680 50-Inch 1080p Plasma 3D HDTV which I acidentally cracked the screen on.. As good as that tv was, I have to say this one blows it away.. I've always loved Samsung tv's an this is my first LG, but I couldn't be more satisfied. For one the features and contrast ratio (6,000,0000:1) are a lot better and more advanced. The different picture and sound features once configurated will bring the best out if this HDTV. I actually have the tv connected to my Directv receiver, Sony 7.1 receiver, and Yamaha speakers. The AV Sync mode the tv offered helped out a whole lot to sync picture with audio, considering I'm using an external audio mode. The only flaw I've noticed is the slight audio\/image delay caused by the fact the receiver puts out dolby digital audio and me not having digital optical cables from tv to audio receiver directly. I have digital optical cables from Sony audio receiver to Directv receiver, and from Sony audio receiver to PS3 but not directly to tv. Everything connected via HDMI picture wise, but I am going to have to get digital optical cables so they go directly from tv to Sony audio receiver. I was told this will stop slight audio\/picture sync issue.. The passive 3D is pretty badass and a lot more in depth than the 3D I got from my Samsung Plasma with active glasses. Definitely a cinema feel to the 3D. The only flaw once again was the 3D channels on Directv, especifically ESPN 3D, show the audio\/picture sync issue I mentioned about earlier because of cable configuration. Smartv apps are cool but I haven't tried them much. I rather watch Netflix directly through my PS3 but Youtube and Skype included in Apps for tv is cool to have. Haven't tried all the apps content but will review when I do. Last thing I'd like to mention is the Trumotion feature this LG HDTV offers. It definitely makes a difference watching Football games (or other sports), Bluray movies, and Pixar\/Dreamworks animated films! For that type of viewing leave Picture TruMotion feature at Smooth, clear, or User. You can make your discretion to see which one looks best. For regular HD programming and HBO movies and such leave Trumotion off as having it on gives off a Soap opera\/play like look to movies and programs.. By the way this tv is Trumotion at 120HZ and the different Picture Trumotion options show that. The 60Hz you see in the tv info when watching programs is the source of your satellite or cable provider.. Even Blurays come at 24Hz but this Tv does give you Trumotion option features up to 120HZ. Apologize for the long review, but truth is this HDTV is badass and has a lot of features to touch base on for review.Update August 18,2012:As I had figured it would be the case, I was able to completely sync the audio\/picture issues perfectly by connecting optical digital cables from the Sony audio receiver to the tv! Even the 3D Directv channels specifically ESPN are synced perfectly. Makes this tv even more enjoyable now. At $899 hard to beat and I am almost certain it's up there quality, feature, and picture wise with other HDTV's a lot more costly."}

I purchased this mouse because of its rechargeable battery.  However, I am very disappointed with its battery life.  I have had the mouse for few months now, the first month, I had to swap the battery ONCE A DAY, annoying, but not too bad, I would have assumed that a Li-Ion battery would last longer than AA batteries, I cant believe it has to be swapped DAILY.  The biggest problem is that every time you recharge a battery, it reduces its life,  I knew this from the beginning and expected the batteries to last at least a year or two, however I am already am finding that I am swapping the batteries about twice a day.  At this rate, I will probably be swapping the batteries hourly by the end of the year.  I highly recommend going for a mouse that uses standard batteries."}

This monopod for $12 is useful for those outdoor shootings when you do not want the picture or video shooting to be shaky. The material used is fairly good, not like those cheap chinese tripods you buy when the threads of the screw will go away after some usage, the grip is good and the case is good for storage.I will recommend this to be used with a small camera (I use it with my Panasonic TZ5) but may not be good to be used with a SLR camera or a bulky camcorder (why would you want a monopod anyway for that? Tripod is always the only option)"}

Not so with this filter. I've shot in all kinds of conditions and never had any issues. Be smart people! Don't risk lenses that cost several hundreds of dollars by not using a UV filter. It's much easier to replace a filter than a lens., This card is not fully compatible with my Windows XP laptop.

The GTX 460 handles all of the games I throw at it with mostly max settings at 1680x1050 (my monitor's max resolution). From what I've read the SLI scaling is excellent as well... if I want to add an additional card in the future, performance nearly doubles.Bonus, this thing overclocks easily. The stock clock is ~760 MHz, I have mine running at 820 MHz and I think there's a lot of room on top of that.I have this paired with a i5 2500K and 8 Gb of Corsair Vengeance RAM... really nice.Grab one of these or go for the more expensive lifetime warranty version for $20 more (I think).--- I'm so bummed these have become more expensive, I've been looking to get another to SLI.

{"reviewerID":"A210D95C1C9WJA","reviewText":"I wanted new iPod speakers for my home office, so I decided to test a few out.  I picked up the Altec Lansing inMotion iM9 and I liked the quality.  It sat on my desk, and faced me from only a couple feet away.  Then I noticed a \"popping\" sound between tracks that annoyed me.  The default volume was way too high when you turn it on, too.  I decided to return it.Then I picked up the Logitech mm50.  Nice design and good sound from small speakers.  It came with a case and integrated nicely with the iPod.  Everything seemed great until I decided to move it to a table across the room to free up space on my desk.  My office is about 15' x 12', and the mm50 was now 10' away from me and didn't come close to \"filling the room\" with sound.  I decided to return it.I have now decided to shell out some bucks for bigger sound, but I still wanted a one-piece system with an iPod docking option.  Keep in mind that by now, I really wanted that iPod Hi-Fi that I've had my eye on.  I decided to compare the Hi-Fi with the Klipsch iGroove, Bose SoundDock and Altec Lansing iM7.In short, the Klipsch iGroove and Bose SoundDock's sound was really disappointing.  Bye.  So now it's down to the Hi-Fi and the iM7.  I don't know why, but I wanted to dislike the iM7 for some reason.  While testing the two, some songs sounded better on the Hi-Fi, but most began to sound better on the iM7.  When I looked closer, the iM7's design really began to grow on me.  I continued to listen to clips of about 30 songs from different genres on the Hi-Fi and iM7 and a clear winner emerged for me - the iM7.  The ability to change the bass and trebble was great, on the Hi-Fi, you can only increase one of them, not both, via the iPod's display.Better sound, great bass, tone controls, a better design, video-out options, and an iPod \"cassette\" enclosure that keeps my music player inside were all great differentiators in favor of the iM7.  After I brought it home, it really did a great job filling the room with powerful sound, with the ability to turn it up fairly loud without distortion.I did my homework, so hopefully it will help you.  The Hi-Fi's great, but the iM7 is a better integrated iPod speaker solution."}

{"reviewerID":"A22PNHEDOUHSLK","reviewText":"Having owned a Canon SX5 and SX10, I am very familiar with this family.  My big decision was whether to jump to a DSLR: Rebel T2i or 60D.  I finally decided to stick with the group and go up to the SX30.  I realize the sensor is smaller and there is no RAW feature, but I don't have a lot of time to sit with images and tweak them in Photoshop.  Living on the beach, I wanted something that would pick out wildlife well, do a good job on the zoom and give me HD video if I wanted it.  The SX30 is a good choice for those and I'm glad I made the decision.PROS:1. They got rid of the four AA batteries and went to a proprietary lithium ion.  Great choice; it really makes this camera lighter than its previous models.  Get a second one on E-bay and use as a back up.2. The grip is a bit larger.  Makes it feel more sturdy in your hands.3. The zoom is just amazing.  Disengage the digital zoom (don't we all?) and use the 35X optical.  It's just great, though at the extremes, you need a good, solid tripod especially if you are using video.4. The 720 HD video works very well and you can zoom optically up to 35X.  Again, use a tripod or at least a monopod.CONS:1. No RAW mode.  If that's a deal breaker, move up to the Rebel category, but you'll spend four times as much money to get a zoom length of this size.2. No printed manual.  I always found useful the little 3x5 bound complete guide in previous models as it was was handy in the field.  No such luck here.  You have to print out your own from a supplied CD that has it as a .pdf file.  I was able to find a third party that sells something similar to what they used to provide, but when spending this kind of money, Canon should throw in a printed manual.All in all, this camera is a good investment and I highly recommend it.As always, Amazon sent this quickly and in good shape.RECENT UPDATE:  After some hands-on experience, my only additional comment would be \"get two more batteries.\"  The video mode eats battery life voraciously, so you need to have a few charged extras on hand.  They're cheap enough through Amazon.com.  Don't get caught with your power down.  Otherwise, this remains a great camera."}

{"reviewerID":"A2Q7TPPSS9IYML","reviewText":"The quality of the photos produced by this camera is outstanding. Absolutely no trace of purple fringing on high-contrast scenes. No jpeg artifacts to hide the details. Most of the 5 megapixel cameras I have used produce photos that look good when they're reduced to 1280x1024 pixels or so, but when you look at them in full resolution you see blurriness in the details, or fringing around objects. There is absolutely none of that with this camera.Add to that the ease of use and the wealth of exposure controls (full auto, shutter and aperture priority auto, and complete manual, along with a few programmed modes). This may not be a top end camera for the professional photographer, but it is well suited to beginners to serious amateurs.The only caveat I can think of is the digital zoom. This works by effectively cropping the photo, thereby reducing the final image resolution. It's probably best to let the camera use its full resolution and then do your cropping at your leisure with good photo editing software on your computer."}

{"reviewerID":"A1I8WBJSZIPJE0","reviewText":"This works great as a cheap KVM switch and compared to a lot of the other ones I found the cables for this switch are actually fairly long. This setup doesn't allow you to switch machines through a keyboard combination but does have a remote button that is also on a very long cable. I have this button mounted right next to my keyboard for easy reach.The only thing that surprised me about this KVM switch is that if you are using it for both your Keyboard and Mouse is that you must have both of the USB outputs running into each machine. So 2 in, means 2 out to both machines. I was expecting that you would only need one USB for each machine hoping the KVM acted like a bit of a hub but it doesn't. It shouldn't be a big deal unless you are already low on USB switches.The only other thing that is a minor annoyance is that under Windows, when you hit the remote switch you head the \"disconnected hardware\" audio alert and then again when you switch back you hear the same alert for \"connected hardware\". It is a amazing how quickly you block it out but it is there."}

{"reviewerID":"A13TX487EQNKK7","reviewText":"I've had this camera for almost 2 weeks now--and so far I just love it.  I bought it to replace a 4-year-old Minolta Dimage digital, which while it took good pictures was clearly outmoded, had a small screen that was unusable in daylight, an inadequate rangefinder viewfinder, and lousy battery life (even with Ni-MH rechargables).  So I was ready for something new and more advanced.After doing lots of homework reading specs and customer reviews, I settled on the Z612 Kodak.  What initially attracted me was the 12X zoom, which I couldn't be happier with.  But the other features are equally good.  The LCD screen is spectacular and I can't say enough for the electronic viewfinder, which is bright and clear (I generally am used to the \"put the camera up to the eye\" mode of picture taking, so I love the EVF).  So far I've only taken photos indoors, mostly of my cats and husband, (which means with flash) but they have all come out sharp, clear, and with terrific color.  After finally figuring out how to work my fancy-schmansy HP photoprinter, I printed several 4X6 prints in 6 mp that are now hanging above my desk and are just amazing.  I can't wait to get this thing out of doors.I love the different shooting modes.  The controls are very intuitive and easy to reach with the right hand while I have the camera up to my eye.  The symbols for each function and mode in the viewfinder and LCD screen are easy to read and understand.  I'm still learning, but have recently figured out burst mode, which will be great when I'm shooting from moving boats in Switzerland this summer.So far battery seems find, but I will have to do more shooting to find out how long a charge lasts.  I love that the battery and charger were included in the package.  That's $20-30 right there in savings.My only quibbles, not enough to downrate the camera is that I wish they'd included the full manual in the box.  I had to download 90 pages and print them on my computer, which was a pain--and a waste of paper and ink.  The little start-up manual that comes with the camera is not all that helpful, not to mention that I misplaced the English version and had to try to read the Spanish version.The only other complaint is that the manual and website contains little information on what kind of memory the camera needs and how much it can handle.  I took a leap of faith and bought a 2GB SD card, and, thankfully it works with the camera, but I had little to go on.And finally, the price on the Kodak z612 cannot be beat -- in fact it was nearly half what I paid 4 years ago for the Minolta and is at least twice the camera.All in all, I love this camera."}

{"reviewerID":"A31ULNSN5IBHH3","reviewText":"Wow where do I begin!!! First off I preordered my XB1 back in August as I was still trying to decide which next gen system I wanted to go with. At the time I preordered, the only system available was the standard edition. No biggie as long as I got one I was gonna be happy! So as Nov 22nd rolled around I got a email from Amazon a few days earlier saying that my shipment was being prepared to ship. I noticed in the email my product info stated \"Microsoft Xbox One Console - Day One Edition\". Thinking it was maybe just a typo or system error I ignored it and anxiously waited for the days to pass. Back when I had preordered the system I opted for free standard shipping as I didnt want to pay extra just to have the system a few days earlier. The system is actually a Xmas gift for my son so as long as it arrived before then I was happy. Amazon quoted me a delivery date of Dec 2nd-3rd which was perfectly fine considering all the 2 day and overnight express consoles they probably had to ship out on launch day. Well not only did they get my console to me 2-3 days after launch (Monday Nov 25th) but they also did in fact upgrade me to a DAY ONE EDITION!! Thanks AMAZON!!! You Rock!!!The console itself runs great and is truly a next gen system. No disk drive errors, no freeze ups, just a nice cool, quiet piece of hardware! I was gonna go with the PS4 when both systems were first announced but after looking at the online videos and reading up on it, it just didnt have much more to offer besides pretty graphics. Had Microsoft kept in place all of the DRM and online requirements I would definitely have stayed with the PS4! I have a i7 PC with a GTX 780 and 12GB of ram, so I already have a system that can put out prettier graphics than the PS4 could ever dream of. And before anybody starts to think im biased I just want to point out that I am NOT a FANBOY of either system. I actually own a PS3 with dozens of titles as well as a 360 and Wii. After many long nights up watching vids and reading reviews I just felt like the XB1 was more for my family. Plus having already had a XB live subscription not having to pay for another online service was great. The XB1 takes the cake with all the other bells and whistles that truly make it feel \"Next-Gen\". The PS4 might be a little more powerful but the Xbox One is no slouch! Besides the PS3 was supposed to be much more powerful than the 360 and I was never able to see difference between the two. The new Kinect is light years ahead of the old Kinect. Im personally not a fan of motion controls (age:30 = old school gamer lol) but the Kinect really is a nice piece of hardware! The videos look amazing and voice calling is great! The voice controls are neat once you learn them and the fact that it signs me in whenever I walk in the room is pretty cool. Some people have complained about the size of the console but its really not that big. Once you find a spot for it in your entertainment center it will blend it beautifully. The new controller is a really nice improvement too! I wish it would come with a rechargeable battery kit standard, but I understand these companies dont make much money off the consoles themselves but more so the software and accessories. The bluray player is a nice welcomed addition that was long overdue! All in all this has truly been a AWESOME experience!! No sales tax + upgraded console + fast shipping = Happy Buyer!!! Thanks Amazon!!"}

This is an excellent product to extend your WiFi range all the way from bedroom to living room as long as your electrical circuit under single circuit breaker's control. I was not getting good signal strength of my TrendNet wireless router. It used to be \"poor\" always in my living room since the router was in bedroom. The moment I hooked up this baby, my Galaxy note, iPod, Galaxy tab and also laptops are all showing signal strength \"excellent\" now. All bars are green.Believe me, since I was having problem to stream HD movies from my Synology NAS (DS411+) to my Vizio HD TV via PS3, I was using a 20ft cable from my NAS to PS3. It was not only looking very odd when friends visit our house, also was dangerous when kids run around the hall. This adapter took care of all those problems instantly. This product also has one wired connector, I am using it to connect my PS3 and the rest on WiFi. Please make sure that you plug into wall points directly without using any surge protectors. Make sure that these two points under same CB according to Cisco's instructions (I have not tried across the CBs though). Then connect one to router side and another one to wherever you want it to be in the house including upstairs. You get one wired connection and excellent WiFi signal strength to connect all your gadgets. A+++++ product!!!"}

{"reviewerID":"A3H3SSMA6M73IF","reviewText":"First, let me say that this is by far a pretty darn good tablet. It was ahead of it's time at it's release and there are tablets coming out right now with the same or similar specs.It's a shame it fell short on a few of the more important points, some the fault of the manufacturer and some, the fault of Google.I'll start with the bad. The screen is not that hot. It's likened to a netbook screen, which basically means that the viewing angles deteriorate quickly with any sort of extreme angle before and after 90 degrees. Worse is portrait mode which feels almost like looking at a 3D picture when whatever is on the screen is dark...for many it fatigues the eyes and they just cannot deal with it.These aren't necessarily deal breakers, and they definitely weren't huge issues back in November 2010 when this was one-of-a-kind. The buttons aren't lit, so you'll have to make do with software guidance in the dark.Now, the market is saturated and the G Tablet seems to be falling by the wayside, saved by only the fact that its price has dropped drastically. At the price it's at currently it's still one of the bigger deals out there regardless of shortfalls and the tablet has a healthy and faithful following on enthusiast websites like XDA where it can be modded to kingdom come with all sorts of ROMS.So, shortfalls: The screen, the non-lit hardware buttons and what I consider worst of all, no official Google Market. The market gives these tablets their light and without it users have to figure out how to install apps manually, referred to as side loading. It's easy, but it's an extra few steps and renders this tablet 'behind' the ones being released now. Of course, the tablet can be tweaked to use the market, quite easily in fact but this requires some extra reading and some know-how in case something bad happens. This means it's just out of the typical users range, and not really for the non-techie. Google does not allow their market on non-3G devices or devices bigger than 7\". They've created and released a new more tablet oriented OS but it will take time for this OS to reach the G Tablet, more than likely. Till then, there are those tweaks I keep mentioning.Now for the good. It's powerful. It's running a dual core Tegra 2 chip which isn't even being utilized fully with the OS installed currently. It's running 512MB of RAM which was impressive as of Nov. 2010 and allows it to run apps smoothly. It comes with 16GB of storage which again, is nice to have on a tablet initially. Most of the devices came with 4 and 8GB back then. It's got a nice front camera, a micro SD slot, a full USB host slot which allows one to plug in a flash drive or a keyboard and a standard stereo plug.In the end, I have to mention that I don't want to scare anyone with saying the screen is 'bad'. It's just not for everyone. I personally have no problem with it and I find that I would never use any tablet at the angles at which the picture on the screen deteriorates on the G Tablet anyway. I also have no reason to view anything but books, games and web pages or reading material in portrait mode, and in those circumstances it actually works very well. Portrait games look good in my opinion and most games that require the accelerometer require you to motion side to side, not tilt the screen front to back so angles that cause issues are of no real consequence. With tweaks and such, the tablet just screams.I recommend it for any and all but the least tech knowledgeable people. If you can read and understand, you can enhance it and tinker. If you can deal with the screen issues, you will enjoy this device thoroughly.Pros:A potential powerhouseFeature packed vs. others on the marketSolid and sturdyAffordable and quite a dealVery modable with a healthy community behind itA definite tinker machine for enthusiastsCons:Requires tinkering to unlock true potentialScreen is somewhat lacking for manyPortrait mode can fatigue the eyesWorks but isn't the most user friendly tablet experience initiallyNeutered somewhat without the Android Market"}

It is sturdy enough that it will protect it from normal activities.  It is not carbon fiber so it is not going to do much for a hard strike on the cover. It does hold my Fire very firmly and the strap holds the cover closed. I guess it will have a plastic smell for a while because it is plastic after all but I did not think it was all that strong and think you really have a great nose or like sniffing things if you think the smell is too hard to take.

I suppose technically I didn't need to buy a new camera, but the Sony had started to get a little glitchy and I'm going on some trips in the near future that I knew I'd want to document. Plus I had a little extra money to spend...I was prepared to spend $250+ on my new camera, but after looking at lots of reviews, I decided on this one.When I got the camera, the first thing I did was to take some test shots (indoors and outdoors) with the Panasonic and my old Sony. Initially, I was little disappointed with the indoor pictures my new camera took compared to the old camera. The outdoor pictures were clearly superior,  however.After playing around with it a little, though, I figured out that all I needed to get the indoor pictures up to snuff was to adjust the exposure by +1. This made a world of difference. Outdoors in bright light, the Auto Intelligent feature works great.I'm sure as I encounter different environments for taking pictures I'll have to play with the settings a little more, but I'm confident this camera offer superior quality to my Sony and is a good replacement for simple high-quality point and shoots needs.It would be nice if the Auto Intelligent feature took care of all this right out of the box. Hence the four star review as opposed to five. Other than that I am happy and would recommend."}

This is my 2nd Roku device, use them both on 2 different non-internet TV's.  And ROKU is the only one so far w\/ Amazon Prime streaming video.  Chromestick?  Nope.  The WiFi receiver on this seems really good, I've never had a dropped signal even tho its clear across the house from my router.  Zero complaints.  Small size, fits out of sight behind the TV and powers from the TV USB port, so no extra cords needed.  It can be plugged into a wall outlet if your TV doesn't have a powered USB port."}

{"reviewerID":"A12JDJ2OG9FCL0","reviewText":"The battery and tools arrived within a few days.  I had already opened up my old, Classic, 4th generation 60GB Ipod using a credit card.  If you are opening an Ipod like mine for the first time, start with the top of the Ipod.  If you break a plastic case tab or two on the side of the Ipod, the next time you could possibly open your Ipod from the side where you broke the side holding tabs.  You'll see lots of videos with people opening the Ipod from the side ... but that's because they have broken, plastic holding tabs located on either the left or right side of the Ipod.  I found it impossible to open the Ipod from the side with all good plastic tabs.  The top and bottom of the Ipod case is free of holding tabs.  I found one video that showed opening the Ipod from the top ... and that's the correct way to do it; especially for the first time.  Don't worry if you have broken, plastic tabs.  The Ipod will hold together very nicely and you won't know the difference.  To remove the battery, I used a small screw driver to pry the battery from the side.  Use light pressure and wait a little and the battery will eventually lift up from the sticky glue.  The battery holds a charge and I'm impressed the entire repair job costs under $10 and my 2005 vintage Ipod works like new again."}

I do a lot of gaming and demand performance from all my components. The Corsair Vengeance offers that demanded performance in 1600MHz. I tend to do a lot of overclocking and this RAM has held it's worth in gold. However, I have recently required 2400MHz in my overclocking and have recently upgraded.If you are a gamer that demands the most of their RAM, these sticks are the best for the price. They are efficient at stock voltages, economically efficient, effective at demanding games such as BF4, and dissipate heat very well with the built-in heat spreader. The 16gb setup has provided me with the flexibility I need to overclock, game, and perform intensive tasks such as 3D molecular modeling. Most games and programs won't require anything more than 1600MHz so these sticks are the best bang for your buck! If you are a overclocking junkie like me, look around at some 2400MHz options including Corsair's options!"}

Maybe you can fit both in the case if the iPad doesn't have a skin of any sort on it, but with any sort of case on the iPad or keyboard, it's a very very tight fit. So tight in fact that it's not really practical to use to carry both. And as a keyboard only or iPad only case there's enough extra room in it that I feel like it's a waste having such a big case for such a portable device.That said, I think the case is very well designed, it looks good, and it feels sturdy. I'd recommend the case, just not for the iPad\/keyboard combo.EDIT: After getting an iPad 2, I wanted to add that the combination of the iPad 2 and keyboard doesn't fit any better than the iPad 1 did. If the case had two zippers that might have helped but it does not. It is doable but still not very easy to zip it up with both an iPad and an Apple keyboard. I was testing it with an iPad 2 with no cover or case plus the bluetooth keyboard with a very thin leather case on it."}

{"reviewerID":"A1N60SIGZ8J2WF","reviewText":"We use the device for internet streaming and disc playback. It replaced a Sony unit we returned due to streaming speed issues.The disc playback of both Blu-ray and DVD's is good. The upgrade for DVD playback brings them close to HD and is a good improvement over our older DVD players. The real plus is the streaming ability on this machine appears to be quite good. I have a 15+ mbps internet connection and have not had any instances of the unit not being able to stream our selections in HD. This was not the case for the Sony unit we returned.The unit does not come with Amazon Instant Videos installed but it was easily downloaded by the player. The setup to the various services was typical Some people have said they don't care for the user interface but I have not found it any better or worse than other units we looked at. In general searching with the remote can be tedious but on a whim I tried out my Lenovo wireless keyboard and it works well with the various search facilities, web browser and media service setups.As far as things I would like to see changed the biggest is the location of the Netflix key on the remote. It is the same size as the &#34;Play&#34; key and is located just below the &#34;Play&#34; key and in between the &#34;Home&#34; and &#34;HUB keys making it easy to hit accidentally. It would be much better located away from this area. In general making the remote a bit larger and spreading things out some would be helpful. The other area that I think they made a mistake in is the use of top mounted controls. This restricts where I can stack the unit in the entertainment center. Samsung is not alone in this regard and I think the industry needs to reevaluate their style over function weighting.Over all I am pleased with the unit and would purchase another one based on my experience so far."}

{"reviewerID":"A1E1LEVQ9VQNK","reviewText":"I've seen a number of Bluetooth mini-speakers with a cube shape like the Remix5. Most of these, however, are not water-resistant and shock-resistant. The Remix5 is wrapped in a thick rubber sheath, with the opening for the power switch and charging port being sealed with a hinged rubber flap. At 3&#34;x3&#34;x2.9&#34; and weighing only 8.8 ounces, the Remix5 doesn't take up much space or weight in a bag or backpack if you carry it with you. The rubberized sides and rounded edges won't poke holes in anything either.Bluetooth pairing was simple and quick, with the speaker pairing as device &#34;Remix5.&#34; With three positions, the switch on the back of the cube is a bit unconventional compared to other similar devices. From the off position, slide the switch all the way to the right to enter Bluetooth mode, indicated by a flashing blue LED. Slide the switch to the middle position if you want to connect the cube to an audio source with the included 3.5mm audio cable. The cable is an unusual split design that allows its use as an audio cable or as a USB charging cable. The speaker also has Near Field Communication (NFC) capability for one-touch pairing, but I didn't have any NFC devices to test this with. The audio quality was surprisingly good for a small 3&#34; cube. With a single speaker in the cube, the sound is monophonic, of course. The 5-watt maximum output easily filled the medium-sized room I was in.I found one error in the user guide. Under &#34;Music Controls,&#34; to advance to the next track or return to the previous track, it says to press and hold either the &#34;+&#34; or &#34;-&#34; button, and to adjust the volume, just press the &#34;+&#34; or &#34;-&#34; button. These instructions are reversed. To adjust volume, press and hold the button; to change tracks, give the button a quick press.The Remix5 has a built-in 2200mAh rechargeable battery. Using the included charging cable, I charged it overnight with a 5V~1A AC adapter. The specs indicate that the cube will play for up to 6 hours on Bluetooth, and up to 10 hours when hard-wired with the 3.5mm audio cable.With its resistance to moisture and the thick rubber protection against banging around, the Remix5 looks like a good choice for carrying on hiking or camping trips, or anytime it would be in a damp environment, as well as for use at home. A carrying strap that's included is a nice touch.A product sample was provided for review purposes."}

It's a case that fits well (mine slid right in with no problem), and for whatever reason, it seems to hold snugly without moving even though there is no stopper at the bottom really.

If you have nails, sure, otherwise, you'll have to manipulate the thing until your finger can jam inside to access the button.  Not really worth the price in my opinion, but there honestly aren't many other options that I could find.  The clip is the saving grace as it allows for clipping on shorts during workouts, which is better than in the pocket, where it could fall out say, when doing bench press.

{"reviewerID":"AJDYMAFXHWY1R","reviewText":"Setup of the Roku was pretty simple, started up downloaded new software update and was simple to create an account.  Creating a account does require a credit\/debit card.  The main reason I got this was mainly to have access to Pandora and Amazon Prime Instant Video on my TV without hooking my PS3 or laptop to the TV.Although I bought it just for Amazon and Pandora to start, I figured with all the channels they had there would be something useful I liked.  After awhile I realized that almost (not all) but a lot of the channels are junk or nothing that I care to watch, or that can be accessed freely on other devices such as a PS3, or Blu-Ray player.  And while there are many paid options available, all of the options are available on other devices I have.After a couple weeks the Roku started having issues loading any videos and would give a \"Service Unavailable\" message every time I'd load a video (from Amazon, Netflix, Crackle), if by chance I didn't get the error the movie\/video would load for awhile and stop randomly and then give the error.  The only way I found to reduce this is to change video output from 1080p to 720p  (and I know for a fact that my internet speed is not the problem).Ever since Amazon has released their video service on the PS3 (Which streams HD with no problems at all) I have little use for this box now.  While it is a neat box, and really wish it worked better for me, it just falls short of my expectations so I'll give it 3 stars.  If the Roku was able to load all the video services for me under 1080p setting (Which my PS3 and Blu-Ray can perfectly) I would definitely keep using this box, but as it stands, it just has too many issues for me liking."}

Panasonic have very nice sd and hd broadcast performance. SD programs looks much better. DVD's works very nice. dishnetwork woom HD is almost perfect., HDDVD's are awesome..most of the 1080p TV's have problems on SD and 720pHD signals.because of the downconverting. this is the reason that I switch back to 720p tv because I am watching mostly SD dvd's and broadcast HD. I have HDdvd but there is not a lot HDVDs available right now.When the 1080p TV's figure out the 720 down converting with reasonable price. (less then$2000) I'll go with 1080p, but right now this panasonic is the best.it has very nice black and awesome colors. factory settings is not the best. you should adjust them a bit. The setup that some people said over this site is actually pretty good.Good thing on this tv is it memorizes all the setting that you made for each device. for example I like SD dvds with less sharpness and noise reduction. but I want my xbox 360 with high contrast and no noise reduction. so it's keeps all the settings individually.it has Antiglare but is not a huge wow!. it's blurs the reflections and make it more reasonable but if there is a lamb in the middle of the room, it is not magically erase the reflection.I didn't test the speakers, I have no idea, but if you have this tv, you should pay little more and get at least 5.1 sound system.So I am really happy with the tv. It was great picture quality with no artifacts on SD or 720p HD,it is not too heavy like my old HD plasma, still heavy but not too badand the box is fits to my mid size SUV with a little tint.I hope my review help you guys, have fun."}

Looking up directions on the internet and firing off random attempts really sucks, so I appreciate that.However, what it has in good directions, it loses points for in execution. I've noticed it tends to delay, lag, mix up the order of letters because of the lag, or just not read a letter or two. Any time you pause for more than three or four seconds, it seems to hibernate briefly and need to be kicked back into gear. I still like the product, I just had to slow down my typing a little and type the first few letters slowly. The placement of the right side shift and the enter key are very incongruous with a normal keyboard, which can be slightly problematic if you've popped onto an instant messenger, and annoying when typing a text document.Overall, I'm glad I have the keyboard.

I purchased this radio so I could carry it throughout my home and listen to certain AM broadcasts without loosing too much signal fidelity. This radio is excellent in that regard.Secondly, although this radio is pretty small, the sound quality is pretty darn good. It has a weighty sound that makes music sound appealing and voices sound nice and heavy without sounding overly bassy or nasal. The Sangean PR-D5 will not replace a full-size boom box but for the private listener, I feel it will be more than adequate for both music and spoken word.I hope Sangean will eventually expand on this radio to include additional features like bass and treble controls and especially a 'lock' feature that would prevent the radio controls from being used when carrying the radio in a bag when traveling. One final wish-list feature... incorporate the rechaging feature of the Sangean PR-D7 so that recharable batteries can remain in the radio and charge."}

{"reviewerID":"A13DLZQ0UBPQNW","reviewText":"From a sound standpoint, these are really great speakers.  I am using these as the main speakers for a home theater and regularly watch DVD music concerts.  They accurately reproduce the music very well, and don't have brassy highs like many speakers in this price range have.  I am a big fan of the double-8 inch woofers instead of a single larger one; they are \"fast\", accurate, and don't have a muffled sound like my last 12 inch speakers.  I should note that I am also using a powered sub-woofer, but have it turned pretty low.Unless you are a professional speaker critic with a perfect environment to play your stereo in, you'll be happy with these speakers.  The factory packing\/boxes are very sturdy and protected the product well during the shipment period to my home.The only thing that I am really not very happy about are the front screens.  In the picture, you see the raw speakers, but do not see the screens, or covers.  They are a metallic silver, instead of a more traditional black.  I am not real happy about that, but the sound quality pretty much off-sets that."}

{"reviewerID":"AR2CNS0JK09ET","reviewText":"I purchased this at a great price! Delivery was very quick! I had a problem setting up and connecting to the internet because of distance and walls from our router. I called Fios because I was getting an error message that the WEP Key I was entering was not the right amount of characters. However I was entering the correct WEP Key and Fios advised me to call Sony. Sony actually figured out that my siganl was weak by asking what I saw on my TV screen under signal strength. They advised me to move the router closer. I called Fios back because I could not move the router any closer. They told me to check to see if I could get setup in the room with the router just to be sure the Disc Player wasn't the problem. If it wasn't they told me I would need a booster for the signal (costs about $80) or run a wired connection. I was able to setup and connect in the room with our router, no problem. I priced boosters and also looked up how to boost a signal on the internet. One site mentioned something about your router being close to the floor. It said to move it higher and point the antenna in the direction you wanted the signal to be stronger. Our router was on the bottom shelf of a TV stand. I decided to try this before spending money on a signal booster or wiring since I already setup the Disc Player to connect from the other room. It worked! The signal strength still does not show a strong signal but I think because I setup the Disc Player from the room with the router it may have made a difference. I don't know for sure but its worth a try if you are having problems connecting before spending money on a booster or setting up a wired connection or returning the Disc Player. Using it is a pleasure. There is a slight delay when you first turn it on but nothing compared to my PC. Didn't need to read how to go through the menus. If you use a computer you already know. The picture and sound quality are great, especially compared to my old dvd player. I have a Sony Bravia tv so I don't even need my TV remote to change the input. I am very happy with the product and would definitely purchase from this seller again."}
{"reviewerID":"A2UNEEEJNHGS2D","reviewText":"I just got this package and I am quite pleased.  Firstly, the case is an improvement over the one that the Kindle comes with.  It has a slimmer profile and a cutout in the back, for the switches. (The original case does not, and I found it was starting to bend, from reaching under it,to turn the device on or off.)  It holds the Kindle very securely and I like the snap closure. I am confident that it will stay closed. Also,I am among those who like the fact that this case can stand up, freeing your hands.Secondly, the light is nice. It takes AAA batteries, which you can get anywhere, cheaply. (Button batteries are more expensive, less available and often harder to put in.)  The light can stand on its own or clip to the case. I clip it to the top.  If positioned well, it gives off light that is adequately bright, without causing any glare.  And, since it has an LED, you will not have to replace a bulb.I highly recommend this package."}

The modular cable design is a great idea for SFX computers, but I did have a harder time installing this power supply due to the cables needing a bit more clearance than a non-modular power supply's cables do. I find it completely worth it though. I have a Silverstone Sugo SG06, and the support bar and slim drive bay sits about 3\/4 of an inch in front of the power supply, making it a tremendous pain to plug or remove the cables. This PSU can run my A8-5500, decked out itx mobo, and Asus Radeon HD7790 2GB without even heating up. It's a bit pricey compared to full sized power supplies, but for a gold-rated, top-quality power supply it is completely worth it, especially considering that this PSU is about half the size of a standard power supply."}

I use it to connect extra USB ports on my computer, as well as a Sony multi-card reader.  I also have a Bluetooth dongle and an infrared dongle connected to this; it's great because those dongles are pretty big and I don't have to worry about them taking up ports behind the computer or jutting out of the front USB ports.  I'm not sure why the first one I had failed, but hopefully this second one will last longer.  It's very easy to install, though the Velcro it comes with is a bit weak for the two heavy dongles I have on it.  I just bought a stronger Velcro and problem solved."}
{"reviewerID":"ADRJKBDU6605U","reviewText":"I was simply looking for the geo-tagging functionality. With the built-in mapping many image editors offer, this type of geo-tagging is underwhelming.  The system uses wifi hotspots and then determines the location via skyhook.  Accuracy seems to be suspect as I took a picture from my back door, then one in my living room and the location associated with the two images was vastly different.  Considering I take pictures in locations that probably don't have a hotspot in range the product just doesn't work for me.  If you are looking for a way to get your pictures from your device to your computer or internet service, it does that pretty well but you won't need the higher end card like Explore X2.  I will stick with my 16GB SD cards and use my phone or mapping software for geo-tagging."}

{"reviewerID":"A29HUC2XR37KDD","reviewText":"I am comparing these to the Sony MDR-RF970RK, which I purchased a few months ago. Chances are if you are looking for some cheaper wireless headphones you are considering them too. here is the link http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-MDR-RF970RK-Wireless-Stereo-Headphones\/dp\/B000PCEFXQ\/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1358435669&sr;=8-4&keywords;=sony+wireless+headphonesHere is the short version read below for more:Pros:+ better sound quality+more comfortable+Less bulky+ good range+Less expensiveBetter volume controlCons:- contact charging not induction and overall poor charging design- cheap cables- not the best sound qualitySo to start,I gave the sony headphones a 3 star, and these rocketfish headphones a 4 star. Neither pair gives a good quality sound as there are frequent pops and interruptions in the signal. This pair while lacking options that the other had (such as auto shut off and induction charging) still reigns superior. Why? Well first its significantly cheaper (at this time) and performs just as well, and sometimes even better. At about 20 ft away I get perfect signal, and they sound great. 2 ft away and for whatever reason its not so good. Neither pair really works well for music. This pair is on my computer the other is on my tv amplifier. If you are looking fore wireless this is the best I have experienced. The volume control is easy to use, as you simply press up or down on the right side, and charging is easy. Besides sound quality I have a few more complaints. One is that the unit must be on to charge. Another would be that they really skimped when they give you cables for this. They gave a 6 ft rca to rca witha 1 ft rca (female) to 3.5mm. basically a way to convert the cable to 3.5mm. I was hoping for 2 discrete cables. Lastly I should note that these are more comfortable."}

{"reviewerID":"A261Z4FIXFIA5T","reviewText":"After spending a couple weeks doing research on HD radio receivers (with it BUILT-IN, not \"capable\") at retail stores like Best Buy and online, I bit the bullet on this unit through Amazon. The unit shipped fast, and there were instructions to install (it also comes with everything necessary but the wire harness), as well as a 1 year warranty.I bought this unit because it was the cheapest unit with all the features I wanted (HD Radio & USB), and also because I love the colors and way that radio presets are handled -- instead of there only being 6 buttons along the bottom so that each band can only have 6 presets like most other receivers, this unit just has an up and down arrow which you cycle through for each FM band, and has up to 18 presets for each -- and I use that amount! Also, the unit can auto-detect usb\/aux inputs which is cool.While I love many features of this unit, I do have a few issues...first of all, don't be sucked into all this \"capable\" BS. Bluetooth capable, etc means you need to purchase a $60-80 add-on; it is cheaper (and less of a hassle) to just buy a unit with bluetooth built in. Secondly, the way usb is handled is sort of...terrible. The navigation is just flat out awful (and I'm a computer scientist; I'm supposed to be good at this stuff!) and after reading the manual just realized it is easier to simply use the usb port as a charger, and then use the aux input to play audio so that I can control everything from my device (a blackberry). Sad, but it really is much simpler...Lastly, the remote is pretty basic and unneeded; still, I am not a fan of remotes for car stereos, so maybe I am just biased.All in all, I recommend this unit, especially because of its low price."}
{"reviewerID":"A2JR10TRIJXJ3R","reviewText":"The sound through these is muffled and thin. My iPod stock earbuds are better, and similar inexpensive, comfortable, and lightweight headphones would also sound better.The lack of definition in the treble on these headphones is a disadvantage when used for internet phone service such as Skype. Speech is far more intelligible with accurate hearing of high frequencies. These headphones have a weakness exactly where they should have a strength.I am surprised at the poor sound quality considering the superior signal path going through the usb port compared to the cheap headphone connector on my Powerbook. Any decent pair of headphones connected through the standard headphone jack will sound better than these.In addition to disappointing sound quality, these are the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever worn. I own three pairs of good stereo headphones (1 Grado and two Sennheiser). The Grado's have a reputation for being uncomfortable after a while, but these Logitech headphones are intolerable after only a few minutes. I was amazed because I can usually tolerate less than optimal ergonomics in headphones. These things feel like they were designed as torture devices by Soviet gulag staff.I'm sending these right back, and I strongly recommend you don't buy these without first trying on a pair to be sure that the sound quality is adequate for your needs and that you can wear them comfortably."}

ION claims a fifty hour charge time and so far I can't challenge this, I purchased the ION nearly two months ago and am still running on the initial charge, probably twenty to thirty hours of use suggesting little or no charge depletion when not in use. The only feature lacking is a strap or handle as the device, while not heavy, is nearly impossible to carry with one hand."}

I have used both the aluminum version of this tripod and the carbon fiber version and I find them both to be fantastic tripods: rugged, stable and easily adjustable.This carbon fiber version is lighter, and it absorbs the vibrations more than the aluminum version, but of course it also costs more.The basic facts for this one are:Maximum Height: 69.7\"(177 cm)Folded Length 24.2\" (61.5 cm)Supports 17.6 lb3 Section Design4 Leg Angle SettingsFlip-lock LegsWeighs 3.9 lbLow Angle AdapterThe low level adapter lets you get a few inches from the ground, and it is attached to the bottom of the center column for quick access.If you are wondering what the difference is between this one and the 055CXPRO3 it is that the 055CXPRO3 model has a special feature that allows for the center column to be used in a horizontal position which lets you get into lower angles more quickly than by using the adapter on the 055CX3. The down side is that it makes the tripod about an inch longer, when folded, and in my opinion makes it a little less stable. If you're doing a lot of Macro stuff, then the 055CXPRO3 might be a better bet, otherwise I would suggest this one."}

Not the best in terms of color matching, but just fine for standard business presentations.I'm very pleased with this projector. I'm using it in the office for run-of-the-mill PowerPoint presentations, and it works very well for those. No more having to have people huddle over a screen - everyone can see the images at the same time!Setup is straightforward, as is hooking it up to a PC (a Windows 7 laptop). The projector is compact and lightweight, which is good, but I would be concerned about traveling with this. It does not seem rugged enough to withstand much abuse. I'll be using it in the office 95% of the time, and only taking it to a client site once in a blue moon (and only local clients at that), so it should be fine. If you're a regular traveler at the least you'll want to get a very good case.The picture quality was pretty good. Images are very bright and easy to see even in a lit room, despite the fact that I'm projecting it just on the wall, rather than on an actual screen. Quiet when running, and it has an \"eco\" mode that uses less electricity (and supposedly also extends the lamp life).My only quibble is that the colors are a bit off. Not way off, but enough to be noticeable on images such as logos where I had a point of comparison. A bit of fiddling made it better, but it still was not perfect.This is not a significant issue for my needs since I'm only projecting PPT charts and graphs where spot-on color matching is irrelevant. But, if you have more precise color rendering needs, this may be too basic of a projector for you.Excellent choice if you need a basic projector for the office that works well, is easy to use, and won't break the bank. Highly recommend."}

{"reviewerID":"A1H0VNARZY29Q9","reviewText":"I purchased this on advance order so was one of the \"beta testers.\" If it wasn't for the firmware updates which were obtained through an audio video forum, I would be very unhappy with this purchase due to several serious problems with this unit and others produced in 2007. There have been 3 firmware updates since the release last fall which addressed most of the problems including audio lock on problems. No information about them is posted on the Onkyo website. Customer support is worthless. The unit can only be updated using the serial port. The last remaining problem is a color space issue when using the Reon. Onkyo continues to fail to address this issue so many of us who belong to the forum do not even use the Reon. Since Onkyo hasn't been forthcoming about updates and they have now released their new product line, it is not likely there will be any more firmware updates. People purchasing the new product line have not yet confirmed on the audio video forum whether the new line has the same issue. Hopefully they don't or they will be in the same boat the rest of us who bought the 2007 line are in. I will never buy another Onkyo product again. It's unfortunate rather than make their product better for their existing customers they continue to choose to ignore us. If it wasn't for the firmware updates obtained throught the forum I would have given the unit 2 stars. Poor customer support and the last remaining issue give it a 3."}

{"reviewerID":"A27QXQQOLAMRRR","reviewText":"I have had this item for some time now. I wanted to wait before I offered my review of the NotePal - Cool Master. I really like it's angle as well as the fact it's made from aluminum and has some nice rubber feet to hold it on the desk properly.CONS:1. It is too short! I have a laptop that is a widescreen 15.4\" monitor and this device doesn't fit on it the way it should. The depth for were the laptop actually sits in only 8 3\/4 inches. After that it slopes down and makes the last inch or 2 of this device USELESS in supporting a laptop properly. VERY BAD DESIGN CHOICE ON THE MANUFACTURES PART!2. The fans are worthless peices of junk. Mine are already rattling and I've only had it a few months. I now have to purchase new fans that are of better quality and install those on this device.3. The front of the laptop support area were the front edge of your laptop will rest is angled in too much. Even though my laptops front is angled it still hits right on the speakers of the laptop. I don't like this at all. put some 3m foam tape in there so it wont scratch up the front side of my laptop as well as block the speakers or sensor for my remote.Pros:1. The simple on off switch on back is easy to hit and is a nice add to the notepal.2. It's wide wich is a great help, would just love it to of been deaper.3. It's built in a way that the fans can be replaced when they die which unfortunately I already have to do.4. the aluminum construction is the best point of this device. It's able to take the abuse that can accur at the desk, so the frame will last.OTHER: I would of liked to of had some USB ports added to the sides near the front (would have been a nice little addon). I also would have liked for some better quality fans as both of the ones on mine rattle like a son of a gun now and I now have to replace them.Fix for shortness. I did a bit of a getto fix for the short laptop support area of this notepal. at the back edge just before it slopes down there is a grove. I just took 2 old pens of the same style and set them in the grove and the laptop ontop of those to creat enough room under there, I will fab up a metal shelf later on when i get the time.If this device wouldn't have been really needed at the time as well as cost a lot to send back I would have sent it back for the shortness of it as soon as I went to test it out and found that it was too short. But now that I have kept it I will be modifying it to suit my needs as it's metal and this can be done more easily than with all the platic peices of junk out there."}

It does not compute gas mileage.On the other hand all the basic, necessary features are there such as voice prompts, clear display with actual speed, street names etc. It knows (depending on the map) where you can find gas or a hotel in the vicinity and this saved my day a few times already.I wish it displayed the names of the local town, as well as maybe the gas stations or other points of interest but this still foots the bill for what I was looking for: mostly a way not to get lost any longer.The ETA prediction is surprisingly accurate."}

{"reviewerID":"A12A95JMREILZT","reviewText":"I received the WD My Passport Ultra 2TB external HD this evening.  I connected it to my 3-month old Dell XPS 850 \/ Windows 8.1 computer, which immediately recognized the device and displayed a directory for all the files on the HD.  Unfortunately, the directory began to flash on and off at random intervals.  Undeterred, I installed the WD software provided on the drive, and I waited patiently after being told that more up-to-date software was available on line, and waited longer as replacement software was installed. It was only with great difficulty that I managed to register the new product with WD, because the constant disconnecting and connecting of the drive made it difficult for the registration program to accept my typed name, address, email, etc.  I then followed the instructions provided after the installation and product registration was complete and re-booted my PC.Alas, installation of the newest WD software and rebooting made no absolutely no difference.  The WD HD continued to connect and disconnect rapidly but randomly, preventing me from backing up any data onto my new WD external HD.  I searched WD support pages to find a diagnosis for this problem (which has been reported by at least 7 other WD My Passport Ultra 2TB external HD users.  I implemented a couple of the proposed fixes, but none worked.  After 45 minutes of experimentation, I gave up, physically disconnected the failing WD external HD and replaced it with my older (but full) WD external HD, which worked flawlessly.  I removed the newly installed software, re-installed and then updated the software provided with my older WD external HD, and requested that Amazon accept my return of a defective HD, a request that was promptly granted by Amazon.It is conceivable that the apparently defective device works, but is somehow incompatible with my new Dell PC or the Windows 8.1 OS or some obscure default setting in my PC or Windows 8.1 OS.  But I am not an engineer; WD does not provide anywhere on its website a straightforward explanation or fix for the problem, and I do not feel it is the responsibility of the user community to engineer a fix for this or any other problem in connecting an external HD to a standard, plain vanilla PC.  I hope I can find another 2TB external HD that will serve as effectively as my older 1TB WD external HD as my main backup device.  (By the way, the WD-supplied backup software, even on the older, perfectly functioning WD HD was crap.  I used the Windows Vista OS backup software for backup on my old PC, and it was much more intuitive, straightforward, and dependable.)UPDATE: 12-23-2013 - After returning this item, I went to a specialized store and obtained recommendations for an external HD.  After discussing the alternatives with a knowledgeable expert, I purchased (at his recommendation) the very same WD My Passport HD model that earlier failed.  His comment was:  \"All hard drives will fail someday, and a small percentage will fail immediately. Yours happened to fail immediately.\"  He thought the WD Ultra HD offered the best combination of speed and simplicity; he uses it for his own personal laptop PC.  I brought the new HD home, hooked it up speedily and without incident, and it has worked fine for a week.  In fact, I restored a defective file onto my home PC with very little effort.  We'll see how long it lasts.  So far so good."}
{"reviewerID":"A1BBYSMT9YCODI","reviewText":"First things first: the iMac offered on this page appears to have the Intel Core i5 quad-core processor, NOT a Core 2 Duo. In addition, a more capable quad-core processor, the i7, is available as a build-to-order option from the online Apple Store. Be sure you're looking at the configuration you want. Apple makes four 27\" Aluminum iMac processor setups in all: two with the Core 2 Duo, an i5, and an i7.Now then, on with the show. A quick look around here shows that many reviewers have already discussed the essential hardware and software features of the 27\" iMac. So, rather than repeating stuff that has already been said, I am going to focus this review on my experience of upgrading from a G4 igloo iMac that was running System 10.5.8 .Migration Assistant*I used aFirewire 400 to Firewire 800 cableto move the contents of my old computer to the new machine with Migration Assistant.*The process was virtually seamless, with only a few minor adjustments necessary to the transferred data. Only four applications required reinstallation: ClamXav, iTunes (due to the Soundflower plugin--in any case, no music was lost or damaged), Microsoft Expression Media 2, and a Juniper Networks remote access program (part of a corporate telecommuting package).*Rules for Little Snitch, a third party utility, need to be reestablished.*Customized preferences for Spotlight must be reentered.Magic Mouse*iMacs now come with a wireless mouse as standard equipment. The Magic Mouse is a vast improvement over the Apple Mouse (aka Mighty Mouse) because it doesn't have a roller ball that eventually stops working. In fact, there aren't any external moving parts on the Magic Mouse, other than the on\/off switch.*Expos&eacute; and Dashboard functions are now on the top row of the keyboard, not on mouse buttons.Keyboard*The chiclet style keys took me a little while to get used to, but now I prefer them to traditional \"long stroke\" keys.*For some reason, Apple has made a compact laptop keyboard the standard iMac keyboard (Steve Jobs must be nostalgic for the original 1984 Mac keyboard). Anybody who relies on Page keys for navigation or on a numeric keypad for data entry is out of luck.*An extended keyboard with Home\/Pg Up\/Pg Dn\/Delete keys and a number pad is available as a build-to-order option, along with additional memory and other treats, at the online Apple Store.Audio System*Optical digital audio input and output requires cables or cable adapters with 3.5mm plugs. Standard size TOSLINK connectors won't work. Also, digital audio I\/O is run through the microphone and headphone ports. It is consequently impossible to use headphones or an external mic when the computer is setup for optical digital audio use.*The speakers are a weak point in the design. They are small, underpowered, and sound tinny. I think the igloo iMacs had much better sound. If I recall correctly, they had a specially tuned amplifier--plus the speakers were fairly large and were not built into the computer housing. Users who use their iMac as their main music source or who work with music and sound will want to buy a separate pair of speakers.Using the computer: screen, fan noise, heat, Rosetta*This iMac is all about the gigantic 27\" screen. It's incredibly sharp and bright, with better-than-HD resolution. Excel users will love being able to see columns A-AE and rows 1-95 all at once at 100% zoom. No more wasting time scrolling around and splitting windows. Photos, movies, and graphics all look absolutely fabulous.*I initially thought I would hate the glossy finish on the screen, especially after seeing how much glare demo models at the Apple Store showed. But, as it turns out, the shiny glass isn't distracting at all in my home office. That said, anybody who hasn't ever seen a glossy screen computer in person should go check one out before placing an order.*Something that I miss from my igloo iMac is the ability to move the screen both from left to right (x-axis) and up and down (y-axis). Aluminum iMac screens can only be swiveled up and down, in a fairly limited range.*Under most conditions, the computer runs very quietly. Fan noise is normally inaudible.*The top of the computer can become noticeably hot to the touch. Not hot enough to cook the proverbial egg, but definitely warmer than most other electronic devices (except for the original PlayStation3, otherwise known as the Sony Spaceheater).*PowerPC applications run well under Rosetta. Once it is downloaded automatically, upon demand, it runs invisibly.Some early buyers have reported display problems*Sporadic screen flickering (Update: Apple released downloadable fixes for this on 21 Dec. and 1 Feb.)*Color temperature differences between the top and bottom of the screen*See the Apple Support discussion boards for details (links in the Comments area below)Bottom line: it's the screen, the SCREEN, THE SCREEN!! Massive amounts of screen real estate, combined with fast performance, make the 27\" Aluminum iMac a true joy to use for both work and play. One star penalty for not making an extended keyboard standard and for the terrible built-in sound system.------May 2010 AddendumQ: With hindsight, would I still buy this machine?A: Yes!"}

Until very recently I didn't think over the air broadcasting would be able to fill my family entertainment needs.  After a month of carefully paying attention to what we watch, most of our viewing is done on OTA channels with one or two outliers that are readily available on pay streaming services so, we took the plunge.I live within 20 miles of 18 Digital stations (according to that TV fool website) one only broadcast in VHF (channel 2-13) and happens to be the ABC affiliate, the rest broadcast in UHF (14-69).The first antenna was a free UHF antenna that came withMSI Digital PCI TV Tuner Digi@nywhere A\/D Plusthat I bought to toy with Windows 7 Media Center. TheLG 47LS5700 47-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TVfound 14 channels and couldn't pull in the VHF. Picture and sound quality were actually better on the received channels than over my satellite connection.The second antenna was an inexpensiveRCA ANT121 Indoor Antenna, my LG TV was able to detect 21 Digital TV channels and tune in 18 of them, I was able to get the VHF channel and with some fine tuning of the antenna I had no lost signal (pixelation of the picture) in several hours of viewing.I orderedPaper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA!because of the rave reviews. I hooked it up to the TV, ran auto-tune and came back with 26 channels! This antenna was able to bring in some of the low power channels in my area that the previous two couldn't as well as some channels I had seen on the first antenna but not the second. Unfortunately, all but two of the newly discovered channels were quickly blocked from my channel list because I don't want to watch them, but they're there if I ever want them.  That pesky VHF channel?  It's in but I'm still toying with antenna placement to minimize pixelation.If I can get this one channel to stay locked in, this one is a keeper. While it was able to pick up more channels they were not really added value for my location or situation.  The build quality on this antenna is outstanding. The RF connector is well connected to the RG-6 cable going to the antenna and easily attaches to the back of your TV (the two cheaper antennas RF connectors seize and require rotating the entire cable and antenna to make a good connection).Pros: Exceptional build quality.Picks up weaker stations.Picks up a broad range of stations.Easily hidden.Cons: Situationally, a  little pricey in bang for your buck comparison.I'd recommend going the cheaper route first, if it works, you saved yourself $30-$40 bucks, if not return the cheaper one and get this one."}

In my opinion, this is one of the most important features of a camera, as you can do the zooming up front without burning through pixels during a touchup.  The lens quality is fine.Both of my children have \"C\" series Olympus cameras, one as much as 4 years old (the camera, that is), and love them.

You can toggle to this, but it's a minor hassle. If you prefer the LCD, you'll be fine. Secondly, the software that comes with the camera seems to demand that you store your work in their proprietary \"albums\" buried deep in the program.

I've had the previous 20 and 40 gig models without the color screen, and we also have had the Nano and shuffle.  This model really is in a league all by itself.  The iTunes software is just the best and loading music from CDs or the iTunes store is a very easy, trouble free operation.  I have loaded every music CD I own, around 6,700 songs and a few music videos, TV shows and movies and I still have 50 gigs free.  The color screen on this iPod is just incredible.  It is very sharp and colorful.  This is great when taking public transportation to work to catch a TV show or last nights news cast.  The iTunes store has some free TV shows and movies you can download, and there are also very inexpensive ones you can buy.  It is all well worth it.  I was also able to buy the classic boxing match between Diego Corrales and Jose Luis Ramirez and it looks and sounds great, all for $1.99.  I also like the smaller form factor and the fact that it is not as thick as my older 40 gig model, plus the wider screen is very nice.  This is really a marvelous engineering accomplishment by Apple, very impressive."}

{"reviewerID":"A2LYCFE6NQXLG6","reviewText":"I bought this camera for a trip to Machu Pichu and it broke the day before the hike....from a 3-foot fall onto grass. The features and image quality are top notch but this camera is way too fragile. The lense protrudes so far that if it falls face down it will probably get jammed. Fortunately I was able to get a refund but I was not able to take my own pictures during my vacation. The battery life is not great either. A full charge will get you about 2-3 hours of actual use and video will drain it quicker than that. So a second battery (and maybe a third) is a must for trips where you won't be able to charge for a few days. That being said, the video and image quality is fantastic. It's great to have HD video and stereo sound on a camera. It's a little hard to take clean video though if trying to use the zoom. The button is not ideally placed. The sweep panorama feature is what I'm going to miss the most. I hope other cameras will follow Sony's lead on that feature.  Unfortunately this has been my experience with other Sony products - great features but not durable."}
{"reviewerID":"A1KN5OQGRNENU0","reviewText":"I have been a prominent user of Turtle Beach products (from these Z11s to P11 and PX21 headphones). Turtle Beach makes some pretty great headphones that give out some great sound. Sadly, no pair of Turtle Beaches that I have been in possession with have lasted more than three months. Each time, the sound blows out (like with my recent pair of Z11s), the cord is \"cut\" (you need to hold it in a certain position to receive sound), or the ear-to-headband joint snaps (very common with the PX21). If you are willing to ship your headset back to Turtle Beach in New York every time it breaks, then Turtle Beach is very keen with fast (pending you do exactly as they ask) warranty requests for replacing your product. If you ask me, I recommend theTRITTON 720+ Surround Gaming Headset for Xbox 360 and PS3over any Turtle Beach any day.

{"reviewerID":"A22POZ7DUSQB2O","reviewText":"I ordered 4 of these cables - they seem to be good quality, but the way that they're packaged is bad. The cable is rolled up as if on a spool, BUT there is NO SPOOL. Instead the cables are tied off by twist ties. This means that when you attempt to unroll & use the cable, it quickly becomes tangled up into a big \"furball\". I did not allow time to wrestle with the cable mess, so it really put me behind schedule about a half day. After some serious frustration I finally sat down and untangled the mess and re-rolled the wire up on some foam rubber. Then it's ok. Frankly I would have paid double not to have had to deal with this mess. I did not see any other reviews about this particular aspect of these cables and maybe there's some 'trick' to dealing with them, but I didn't see any option other than untangling them and rolling them back up on a makeshift spool so that as I'm fishing the cable through the attic it would unroll without tangling."}

Now I'm wondering how I ever did without them. Having the ability to lie in bed while listening to my music and Doctor Who audio stories without having to use the speakers on my phone is wonderful. Basically being able to use my phone as a remote is perfect.But I digress. Aside from the convenience factor, I must point out that these things have an impressive ability to pump out sound. Not quite to the point where your neighbors will be pounding on your door telling you to turn down the darn music, you dang kids!, but close. It's even high-quality sound, too, with no real distortion, and it let me hear sounds in my music and audios that I wasn't able to hear before.The one minor complaint that I have is that you have to be VERY careful about plugging the right cable into the right speaker.

I wanted two for a trip in May for my wife and myself.  After using the higher priced Canons with image stabilization and large field of view, everything else does not seem that good.  With the small eye pieces I find it hard with the Olympus  to align my eyes with the eye pieces and therefore see out of both eyes well.  Also keep in mind that when you do use the large zoom option, you are loosing a lot of light which is OK during the day.  This is of course not a good feature in the evenings or night.I know a lot of these shortfalls all come from being small travel binoculars which is why I gave it a 3 star rating instead of a lower rating.  Image quality is good for the size and the zoom is a nice feature, but the image will be hard to keep in the field of view on the largest setting.  If you do have the money, then these work well for the size.  If you can afford to spend more and give some on weight and size, then I really recommend the Canon Image Stabilization Binoculars."}

{"reviewerID":"A1APPDSPQQO022","reviewText":"I chose this set because I wanted to experiment with macro-photography but did not want to tie up a lot of money on something I may use only a few times. Camera auto-focus works properly with all filters, images are sharp and clear. The only negative I have found so far is that the anodized finish on one of the filters has 'holidays' that let the aluminium show through. Not likely to affect the image...Stacking works fine, even with all four filters, as long as you stack them +! +2 +4 +10. Color quality may suffer a bit, though. I noticed some internal reflections - apparently the glass does not have an anti-reflective coating. Minor quibble, especially in light of the fact that most photo guides recommend against extreme stacking like this.Overall, very satisfied."}
{"reviewerID":"A38GZFUV22LJMR","reviewText":"I did a lot of searching for a tower that would hold my ever growing Blu-Ray collection but wouldn't break the bank.  The Typhoon fit the bill perfectly.  It only took about 30 minutes to assemble by myself.  It shouldn't be tough for anyone who has ever put together boxed furniture before.  The directions were very intuitive and parts were labeled very well.  The tower looks great when assembled and works well with my other living room furniture.  I can squeeze 21 standard blu-ray cases without slipcovers in one row, which means this will hold approximately 168 blu-ray titles.  Of course if you have boxed sets, it will be less.  Overall, this tower is a great buy, especially if you can get it for under 40 bucks."}

{"reviewerID":"A3FKL4C8BKMSVY","reviewText":"My wife purchased the Magellan 1340 for me (I purchased a Tom Tom One for her last year). The Magellan has good maps and more useful POIs than our TomTom, so it's easier to find specific gas stations and restaurants during trips. One of the features that caused me to pick a Magellan over another TomTom was the image on the box that shows the multiple lane feature of the Magellan that depicts several lanes and highlights the one your supposed to be in at major interchanges. I was looking forward to testing this as I drove through Atlanta yesterday, but alas, it was a bright day and the screen on the Magellan is almost useless in bright conditions if you happen to wear polarized sunglasses. The TomTom has a much more useful screen in daylight than the Magellan. If it weren't for this one major fault I would rate the Magellan higher than the TomTom but it appears i may have to return the Magellan or give up wearing sunglasses when I drive.Update: 09\/29\/2010.After living with this unit for awhile, I've found one other major dislike; it takes a long time to initialize when turned on. My TomTom is almost instantaneous and can be tasked to map a route within a few seconds, but the Magellan takes several blocks of driving before it even shows a screen where you can ask it to map a route. Not a big problem if you already know where you're going, but if you come from a stop that you're not familiar with and want to know which route is the best then you can count on sitting still for a few minutes."}

(Many I studied only have a shift key on the left side.)Also, the picture here on Amazon gives one no idea, so I went to a local merchant where I could play with a few bluetooth keyboards before ordering this one from Amazon.I'll have to get used to cmd-c and cmd-v for cut and paste, instead of cntl-c and cntl-v.Also, I type Chinese using Pinyin, but the Dvorak layout isn't available (I solved this problem on my PCs with registry changes).So this is a good solution for me as far as typing is concerned, but not perfect.As far as the case function, the iPad fits snuggly, and I wasn't able to make it come out easily.

{"reviewerID":"AU1SKSAF00JJH","reviewText":"From all I've heard of other solar chargers - it's a slow process to get a full charge.  This product is no exception, but a full charge is more than enough to bring a phone and\/or tablet back to life for the day.  If you're out camping or at a music festival this should keep your phone topped off while soaking in the sun to sustain itself for the day.  If you start out fully charged (from AC power at home before you leave), you should be able to stay ahead of the dead battery if you're able to get a few hours of sun.  It feels rugged and has the ports you'll need to suit your phone or tablet. (I had to use my iPhone USB cord to attach).If you're not camping or away from outlets for multiple days, it seems like a backup battery that is precharged would meet your needs without lugging around something this size, so IMO - this is a very particular use product.  But a good one if it's what you're after."}

I also have two power adapters in the spine (instead of the pens), and a mobile phone dock in the bottom left.  As well as my tablet charger in the upper right.Eventually when I replace my mp3 player and tablet with new ones with standard micro USB adapters I can remove two cables and start using the left for my large collection of USB thumb drives.

{"reviewerID":"A1LH6RF4UN9VI6","reviewText":"Having purchased two other universal remotes, I can say that this one is definitely the least impressive of the three. It has some nice features, but when stacked against universal remotes of similar price, it's lacking.\"Regular\" setup of the Phillips Prestigo is done through a program you install on your computer.  That's pretty standard these days.  The problem is that the software isn't very robust.  And if you run into any troubles, the Phillips web site is useless.Setup is pretty easy. If you have a working remote for the device you want to control, the Prestigo can learn directly from that remote. If you don't have the remote, it can learn once you tell it about the device you want to control using the aforementioned software.Lots of the buttons on the remote can be programmed and the remote allows for sequenced programming (turn this on, set it to that input, turn that on). HOWEVER, there's no way to quickly switch between devices.  The remote forces you to back out to the menu, then select your device.  This is a particular pain if one device didn't catch a command in a sequence-programmed button.My biggest complaints are:1. Batteries. None are included nor is the remote rechargeable.2. No backlit buttons.  Think this isn't a big deal? Try changing channels in the dark.3. Pitiful screen. The LCD screen is tiny and hard to read.Overall, I'm not impressed and wouldn't recommend this remote to friends."}

{"reviewerID":"A3SQ3URV0EC4OD","reviewText":"I bought this lens when I'm looking for a lens that I carry all the time. I settled on this one after renting and using it for a while.Here is what I found out:- This lens is very fast and quiet focusing (due to the USM motor). It generally takes 0.2, 0.3 seconds to achieve focus, so you will not miss your shot because focusing is slow like sometimes in the kit lens- This lens is very sharp, the optical quality on this lens is top notch. According technical review of some of the camera magazine, it has almost identical IQ as the very expensive L series lens. Basically, it has same image quality as many of the L series lens. I found that to be true most of the time. The photos I took were very sharp. The downside of this lens, comparing to L-series, is that its shell casing is plastic, so it is not going to be professional grade seal and protection for your lens. For normal people, is very good image quality but probably won't last too long in extreme environment like L-lens could.- This lens is wide angle, 15-85mm. It takes very nice wide angle shots. However, it does have the distortion from time to time at wide angle, which is easily correctable in photoshop camera raw. Some people say there is vignetting, I would say about 20% of time at wide angle, it sometimes has that issue, most of time however it does not.- On the telephoto side, 85mm is very nice for zooming in and get a pretty close shot. I found that this lens focus very well all throughout 15-85mm, I could honestly see no weak spot in terms of taking shots that are sharp. Some lens has the problem that it's only good in certain focal length, not this one, it takes great photos all through out the focal length.- Weight: it's quiet heavy, not as heavy as L series, but heavier than the kit lens.- It has wider diameter than the kit lens, so pretty much you need a new set of filter and lens hood- It has this minor annoyance for me. Some review say that this lens has zoom creep issue. This is true. Basically it means, lens would move by itself (extending the zoom lens) due to gravity. It does not hold still when you point it downward while carrying it.My verdict: Image quality is superb, the focal length is great that allow this to be a walk around lens, focus extremely quiet and fast. It's not as expensive as L-series but with L series matched image quality. Basically, if you're looking for a non L-series lens that is all around good, can't go wrong with this one.I'm extremely happy about this lens after I've used it for about 2 years now."}

I was tired of wasting batteries, and having everything I type be delayed. So, I decided to invest in this guy. When I bought it it was only $49.99. I had never seen it that low, so I thought that I had better snatch it up at such a low price.The typing is just incredible. It makes me want to type tons of stuff just because it feels so awesome. Typing is smooth, and very precise. The buttons don't stick up much and this allows me to type even faster. I type extremely quickly most of the time, and this keyboard keeps right up with me. (at least 80wpm) The range is ok, maybe around 10 feet before it starts dropping out a little, which for me is pretty inconvenient. I need something that is closer to 15-20 feet. But, it has no cables, takes no cable charging, takes no batteries, it is sleek, and it looks sick. What more could you ask for really? Recommended? For sure. Best keyboard I have ever owned by a long shot. Period. Would give 6 stars if possible.:EDIT: Since using this keyboard, I have noticed that it does not like to hold a charge, whether is it turned on or not seems to make no difference. It seems to not want to charge very well either. I will stick it in front of a window ALL DAY, and come home after 11 hours and it will register with a red LED on the sad face. Not sure if it is faulty or what. Maybe I just have bad luck with electronics. The typing is still just incredible. Best feel to a keyboard that I have ever experienced.:EDIT: 8.6.2012I have now owned this keyboard for.. 9-10 months I spose, and the typing is still absolutely incredible. HOWEVER, the keys EASILY break. Rather, not the key itself, but the janky clips that hold the keys in place break if you look at them funny. Not only this, but Logitech does not have replacement keys\/parts, nor will they repair it. They said \"buy a new one\". Seriously? I spent $60 at least on this thing, and they tell me to buy a new one? I will no longer buy Logitech products. Thank you Logitech for your superior out of country service.

The 2 differences between models is the next step up has a zone B setting and a second sub out.  Features that I didn't think were worth another $100 but would have done so for the additional $30.  To be clear, the day I placed the order it was a difference of $100.  But about the product, it serves it purpose for the most part.  When on 2 channel mode it will not produce sound through the sub, even though the sub is checked in the options.  The problem is easily corrected by putting the receiver into 5 channel mode."}

Unfortunately, the Nuvi, while it grabs satellites with uncanny speed, is missing a couple of key features that I need.  I'm sending it back to Amazon, not because it did not work, but because of those missing features.The Nuvi does not give you a \"miles-to-go\" to destination option.  You get a \"time-to-arrival\" display instead.  To me, miles gave me a better sense of how far and long to my destination.My Navigon had a great feature which showed you the points of interest (businesses) along the route.  I found the lack of this feature a killer when I tried to find a hotel room late on a Friday night as an unanticipated stop on my way back from a long business trip.After some fiddling with the GPS, I was able to get a list of the hotels near by, but it would have been much easier if the POIs were incorporatated on the standard display.  I also missed the virtual route signs found on other GPS units.  The visual of a major interchange sign made it so much easier to follow the voice and progress output of the unit.All in all, I'm going to pick the features of my next GPS more carefully.  It will probably be another Garmin model, but as for the Nuvi 1350, well, it just didn't cut it."}

{"reviewerID":"A1AFVIFLYKLK37","reviewText":"Not only is this power supply up to 92% efficient it is also backed by a 7 year warranty. My power savings over my previous supply is about 10Watts when active and 4watts when idle using Kill-A-Watt power meter. The low pitched whine is a result of the more efficient PWM. PWM switches the voltage in the range of 10's of Khz which is audible around 22Khz or less, which leads me to believe their PWM is somewhere in that range. [...] All that aside it is only noticeable if I am next to my computer with the case open. The removable cables are very nice but due to being flat they are less flexible however they do allow more airflow. Overall an excellent power supply. If you are a building a computer for the first time or even a seasoned builder than you should know the one place you don't want to skimp out is the power supply. Most component burn-outs are due to a cheap power supply. Since I started using expensive power supplies 10 years ago I have never had a component fry or cese to function due to power issues. All that being said I got this for $89 on sale at another site. Happy shopping."}
{"reviewerID":"A24FJNGFN0IC4Y","reviewText":"I purchased this monitor to replace a 19\" Gateway HD monitor and I have no regrets. The Gateway didn't have built-in speakers and costed me more than this Viewsonic. I had a Viewsonic several years ago and it was a nice monitor. Sold it to a co-worker when I got the Gateway and she's still using it today. Just sold her the Gateway monitor too when I got my 23\" Viewsonic. The speakers aren't the greatest quality, but I don't use my computer to listen to music or watch DVD's. I don't know what the other reviewer was referring to when she said the print was too small to read. On a 23\" monitor, there is no small print, at least I haven't found any. Maybe she needs to adjust her font size not the screen resolution. Picture quality is great and I love the matte finish which helps reduce glare. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a reasonably priced quality product."}
{"reviewerID":"A8QSD7JP1ESOD","reviewText":"I received the SS-8000 as a Christmas gift and was quite impressed by the design.  I just finished reading through the various reviews and I have to concur with them.  There are several issues with the unit that would preclude me from buying one:1) If the unit is set to \"iPod\" and the iPod is powered down\/removed or the unit is switched to \"Aux\" without an audio source connected there is a definite \"whine\" noise coming from the unit.  It sounds like either a poorly designed power supply circuit that could use better filtering or unfiltered noise coming from the microprocessor that controls the unit.2) The display is way too bright, even on the dim setting and it resets itself when the radio is powered off and on.  Once the unit is out of warranty I am thinking of hacking the dimmer circuit to reduce the brightness on dim.  I would prefer to have a variable control, such as the \"Set\" wheel, be able to adjust the brightness to whatever level I desire and to have it remember that setting.3) The unit seems to have trouble switching through the different modes (ie. Aux, iPod, Radio).  Pressing the \"Audio\" button to switch to a different audio source does not always result in the unit switching.  Sometimes I have to press the \"Sounds\" button to switch it out of audio mode and then press the \"Audio\" button again to get the mode change to work.  The internal microprocessor is definitely not polling the panel buttons reliably and may be related to filtering and the noise issue I noted above.As I mentioned above, had I not received it as a gift, I probably would not purchase this unit for myself.  It has some flaws that could easily be rectified by a design change but whether or not Homedics will do this a good question.  Perhaps an SS-8100 or SS-8001 is in the offing.  For now, I would save my $100 and wait for an improved version or a model from a different vendor."}

{"reviewerID":"A288XW2VPUVYOI","reviewText":"The Samsung 213t is significantly cheaper than other 21.3\" monitors, although it should be noted that you'll spend a lot less on a 20\" monitor. So if you're looking at this one, you'd better value that extra inch. Should you? This depends on whether you like high pixel density or low pixel density. The 21.3\" monitor yields about 94 dpi (dots per inch); a 20\" monitor is more like 100 dpi. Some of the smaller 1600x1280 displays (especially for laptops) go above 120 and even 130 dpi, and some people prefer the high density, even though the text gets smaller. WinXP has a setting to increase font and dialog box sizes based upon the local dpi, but this is imperfect, since graphics, unlike fonts, are not resized. We can argue theory forever, but the essential question is, what do you find easiest on your eyes? For me, the lowest dpi is most comfortable, because it draws larger characters, but I know of people who prefer the high numbers. If you're like me and you want low dpi and a lot of screen real estate, this is your monitor, at least in 2004. (There's a wider model, the 243t (24\"), but it costs about twice as much.) The 213t price has been dropping over the year (with periodic rebates!) and may drop farther, and this model may well be replaced before long.With any modern LCD monitor, be sure to use the digital connection to a DVI video card. The digital connection assures that the monitor will display *exactly* what the PC intends. If you use the VGA analog connection, you'll be open for some smearing and ghosting.The 213t has no frills (no speakers, no USB). Its response time (25 ms) isn't as fast as some other monitors, so it's not the optimal choice for gaming or video. But it's a sharp, clear, large display. For the market niche it fills, it's the best monitor at the best price."}

I have a nikon D90 with intermediate lenses, and it makes beautiful  photos, I have control of all settings, fast, in my hands, no menus, a lot of specific buttons, in few seconds I can do whatever I need... As my D90, at P7700 you have specific buttons for speed, aperture, exposure, and 2 funcional buttons that you can set iso, flash exposure and other stuff...You have the navigation buttons with shortcut for focus mode, macro, flash mode...Even a button, on the left for a specific menu you can set with what is most important for you, and bkt control, iso, and a lot of just there, 2 click or 3 click away.......Never saw a compact camera (okay, p7700 is not compact, is a mid-size camera) that you can do that through specific buttons, without needing go into menu to set..Even entry levels DSLR or older bodies don't have all that functions, or just don't have it easy on your hand, and you can program even 3 user presets and a video mode you can control aperture, I thing this all is fantastic when you just remember it is a mid size camera, but definitely, designed for high end users that take control at most time! That was what nikon was thinking about, because if was for whom rarely uses those controls it could have all that controls, but under menu, like the new line nikon 1 J1,2 and V1,2...If you have to do that through menu, you will simply do auto settings at most time....that cannot be confusing, or you will miss shots...You can go under menu only if you got time to do all settings, on real world, it is rare....That's what I don't like on nikon 1 series...Even have interchangeable lenses on a compact body, I think Is limitation on lenses, and overall equipment will take much room as a tradicional DSLR...And in my opinion, I 'd rather control, of course, if the fixed lenses is good enough to do the job...There are few limitations, like you can't burst in raw, (but ou can do 8fps, that's pretty good) and overall, compared to my D90 it is a bit slow...the p7700 it's a pretty good camera who are used to shoot manual, or P, S, A modes, even on auto mode it can do work very good...There are few limitations when compared to DSLR, like speed, light, (depending lenses you are using), shooting in dark, noise control at high iso, BUT the p7700 will be my everyday camera, because I can put it in my bag, suitcase, or even hold in my hand or squeeze in my pocket (it will fit, but will not feel comfortable to walk around), so I am very happy, because I use my DSLR a lot, but use to have always a compact camera, just to register occasional pictures, parties, meetings and even when traveling (normally I travel with both), for the first time I have a mid size camera that I am fully satisfied with it, photo quality, video quality, and the freedom to work with it, capable to take good photos, without flash, or with built in flash, or external flash, or slave flash using the built in flash....About image quality? After all that, let's just say it is closer to a DSLR than a compact camera. blurry background, excellent colors, sharpening...And I don't believe that other brands on mid size, can do better or worst, just different...What nikon gives to you, will be a matter of taste, not exactly good or bad pictures! It is like to compare top brand premium cars, you just rather one over other, but they are all alike...."}

{"reviewerID":"A1ZU55TM45Y2R8","reviewText":"So I recently bought a projector so that my wife and I can watch movies outside on our deck and the thing came with a tiny speaker built in. So when I had the chance to try out this Bose Soundlink I jumped at it. In short it sounds amazing and I recommend it if you are looking to spend $300 on a speaker.Here's where it shines:1. Bluetooth: the wife and I have android phones and we were both able to pair our phones to this speaker with little trouble and start playing our music. The music was clear and really sounded pretty amazing.2. Battery: this thing has an internal battery you charge via the included AC adapter. I am not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but in my testing I used it for over 5 hours and never had a battery issue.3. AUX input: the projector I bought doesn't support bluetooth buth this does have an AUX input so I was able to plug in a cable to my projector and then to this speaker and it allowed me to play the audio through it, the movie came to live and this was great as that meant I didn't need a power cable thanks to the internal batteries.Where it falls short:1. Cost, While it sounds great at $300 it's on the high end of the cordless bluetooth speakers available today. It is VERY good, but it comes at a premium cost.2. Protection: This speaker doesn't have any type of protection.Previous generations of this speaker had a cover that was built in. This one does not, although you can buy one from bose for an extra $35. Really? If you are already spending $300 for a speaker the least Bose could do is give you a standard case\/cover for it. Because of that I am knocking off one star.All in all, if you have $300 and like Bose you won't be disappointed with this speaker. It's clear and both music and movies comes to life when played over this speaker regardless if it's via bluetooth or a cable plugged into the AUX input jack. I really like it."}

I have so much stuff to pack into my case the my old mid-sized case was cramped to the point of killing most of the airflow in the case. I've had a (small, 120mm block) water cooler for my processor, a 3rd generation i7-3820. in my old case, its temperature would get up to 80C under load, and I thought that was good, because it used to get even higher without the water cooler!In this case, the processor runs literally 20 DEGREES COOLER! AND I overclocked it by 800MHz! The only downside is that the pipes on the cooler aren't long enough to put the block on the rear fan spot, I had to replace one of the large 180mm fans with it. I could have replaced the 120mm fan on the top, I suppose, but I didn't want to remove my only exhaust fan.The only nitpick I have, really (aside from the power cable being an inch too short, like everyone else complains about,) is the hard drive bays. They advertise that you can put in two fans in the little 3-drive block setup, but only one will fit if you have hard drives in it!Another reviewer was right about modular power supplies. Mine is semi modular, and all the permanent cables on mine are used, but if your not careful with the wiring, your going to be getting bad airflow in a lot of places."}

The size of this room is 20'x15', a good size and it sure does fill the room with decent sound.We popped in \"Avatar\" and I was impressed. Sight and sound were fantastic (adding of course an HDMI and optical cable connection).  Then I viewed \"Pulse\" which was live Pink Floyd from 1994 and well, not as impressed.  That's because my reference is the surround system I have downstairs that also cost 10 times more (and enough power to levitate the house). So in comparison to what I'm used to (as far as watching music videos or concerts, it doesn't make for a fair comparision with this or any 2.1 soundbar system.  So, I'll watch rock and roll downstairs and enjoy this little gem when I'm with the family. Besides, my wife hates my type of music preference (she's a Motown girl).I think this soundbar is decent overall (especially considering the low price-paid less than two bones).  Yeah an EQ would've been nice, but the sound clarity of watching movies with this unit is pretty bright. When compared to the sound of the TV speakers, there is no comparison. This is what's known as a step-up process (not a leap-up, spoiled audiophiles).In conclusion, really shop around for this. Most entertainment items available today (especially with Black Friday deals popping up everywhere) are all on sale.  Some of these toys were supersale items,so I feel I got a really phenominal deal for this entire digital package (less than eight for everything).  In my opinion, I would recommend this set up for most ears (sorry hardcore spoiled-rotten audiophiles).  I know that others who voiced their opinion and experience with this unit were looking for a somewhat true high-end surround-like package for aroung $250, Well quess what, that ain't happening here.  This was obviously designed for those consumers who were not content with what sound came out of their new TV. And to those few cheapskate audio brates whose sound candy must be \"just perfection\", go spend a fortune on a high end surround system and stop whining on a decent product that's acceptible to most ears.  I believe the overall star ratings here supports my OPINION."}

I used some duct tape to hold them in place. I climbed up on the wing and pushed play on my Walkman and screamed Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone to keep my head in the game. It was really windy (because I was on top of a biplane) but the duct tape helped to hold it to my big Swedish head. When my flight was over I tore off the headphones and they fell apart. This was not the fault of RCA or its subsidiary companies. In fact, they clearly stated these should not be used by wing walkers on biplanes or secured with duct tape. I give these five stars because Kenny Loggins never sounded so good on top of a biplane. I also peed a little (also not the fault of RCA).Also, the red perfectly matched the lycra I was wearing."}

It actually looks just fine and is solidly built.  It's a standard mini tower.  There are docks for more drives than can be fit comfortably, but a blu ray, SSD and HDD worked without any interference (but it was tight) and I plan on a second HDD at some point (which will make it really tight).The fans are not distracting, but they make a fair amount of noise, nothing that can't be swapped out with better hardware sometime if you need to.Overall, get it if you need something inexpensive for a simple build."}

I didn't really figure out you need the distance to project a larger image.  I'm presently in an apartment in Sant Monica, where, by projecting from the granite counter through a door to my bedroom, now dubbed the screening room, for 25 feet, I get a far larger picture than I got at home.  The beginning of the light projection is small, but must squeeze through the door of the bedroom, which limits how far back I can position the projector.effectively, to achieve a larger picture.  Once I've had the landlords through to go over the lease and find problems in the apartment, I plan to remove the door for as long as I stay, to get the maximum projection in the screening room.  Apple's next act is to invent a projector that literally sprays an entire image over an entire wall, from less than an inch from that wall.  Projectors aren't furniture like the HDMI sets that rise to 65 inch diagonals, but are grotesque furniture in a living room.  Frankly, the picture on 'furniture HDMI sets' is still way too small.  Americans need to discard 'furniture TV' and replace it with projection tv from a very small, mini-circuited gadget like I've described above, for Apple to invent, without Steve Jobs on board any longer.  Maybe the geniuses at Samsung?!.  Americans need to become smaller than the images in their living rooms to totally understand their true place in the world!"}

So I upgraded the firmware and it worked fine. No problems.When I moved home, I had DSL installed and then my problems started. Streaming Video would cause it to crash and my connections would die. I downgraded to the original firmware (factory default) and streaming worked fine. Only problem then was, the router would still crash when I went to certain sites (MySpace.com being one of them).After weeks of trying various settings, I still have connection issues and decided to change routers and go with NetGear.For this router to be great value, it all depends on which service provider you use and what type of connection they have.

The netbook fits in snugly and is well padded and protected.In my opinion, the bag is very well designed.  It sturdy.  Plus, it has numerous compartments that are just the right sizes for items such as power cord, external CD drive, cables, office supplies, cell phone, etc.My only complaint is that the water bottle holder is too small.  It seems to be designed for a 12 oz. soda can and even that is a tight fit.My bag came with both a shoulder strap and a handle.  As some reviewers have said, the shoulder strap is not padded.  However, the strap is broad.  I don't find the lack of padding to be an issue.  Even when I fully load the bag, it only weighs 7 pounds and that's comfortable to my shoulder without padding.Although this bag is advertised as being able to fit a 14.1 inch screen laptop, as other reviewers have said, the bag is too small to fit this size.  I have a 14.1 inch HP DV2000 laptop.  There's no way it will fit--it juts out over an inch.  I think that the Mobile Edge Mini Messenger bag will also be too small for some 13 in. laptops.

It is easy to operate, the sound is very good, the speaker does a very good job, the sensitivity on all bands is excellent, I really enjoy using this radio, I have 7 other short wave radios and this is the best. The SSB works very well and does not drift..The case is nice and can take a beating.Cons.. The frequency on the LED is off by one number, If a radio station is 700 am, the station comes in strongest on 701. That is a factory adjustment that was not done correctly. The problem occurs on all bands, the frequency is off by one number... I also don't like the fact that you cannot scan  the Airline band. The last thing I did not like is the batteries supplied with the radio were not very good.. They held a charge for only 1.5 hours and had to be re-charged. I replaced the batteries with new rechargable batters and got a very long battery life... Other than those 3 things, I think the radio is great..I had the radio shipped to me using the free shipping and I received the radio the day after I ordered it..As the Amazon wearhouse is in lexington Kentucky and I live in Somerset Kentucky just 1.5 hours away I can understand the fast shipping but still it was nice to order the radio one afternoon and receiving it the mail the next morning..

The Mpow Bluetooth 4.0 Audio Receiver Adapter makes this task effortless.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; Mpow Bluetooth 4.0 Audio Receiver Adapter&#8226; 3.5mm audio cable&#9654; AccessoriesThis device includes a thick 48&#8221; inch 3.5mm audio cable. Although I like the gesture of including a 3.5mm audio cable, but wish that MPow would have also included the &#8221; audio adapter as well, considering this device is marketed toward surround sound and stereo systems.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Bluetooth Standard: Bluetooth V4.0&#8226; Bluetooth Profiles: AD2P&#8226; Support Codec: Apt, AAC&#8226; Operating Distance: 30 feet&#8226; Input Voltage: AC 100 &#8211; 240V 50\/60Hz&#8226; Output Voltage\/Current: 5V\/1500mA&#8226; Product Size: 1.33 x 1.65 x 2.16 inch&#8226; Product Weight: 1.5 oz&#9654; HardwareAs said in the specifications, the product is 1.33&#8221; x 1.65&#8221; x 2.16&#8221; inches, or about the size of a golf ball. On the front is the MPow logo and a blue LED light to indicate whether the device is in pairing (continuous flash) or standby mode (on all the time). The sides have a dime sized indent, probably as the point where MPow wants the user to place their fingers when installing. The back has the two prong plug, capable of being plugged right side up, or upside down. The bottom has a USB port, capable of charging devices at 5V\/1.5A, and the 3.5mm audio cable to connect to your stereo system. Overall, the device is constructed simplistically well.This device uses the Bluetooth 4.0 protocol, which is the latest Bluetooth technology, giving you the most energy efficient option, while staying connected. Connecting the Bluetooth to your phone will give you the freedom of choosing your desired audio without touching a CD or dial, which rejuvenates older technology to stay connected with the present.&#9654; Set up1. Connect the receiver to the external audio device through the 3.5mm audio cable.2. Plug the receiver into the standard AC socket. The LED light will flash continually, indicating the device is in pairing mode.3. Keep your receiver and phone within 1 meter when pairing.4. Turn on the Bluetooth function of your phone.5. Search for the Bluetooth devices and select &#8220;MPOW&#8221;6. Enter the code &#8220;0000&#8221; if needed.7. If pairing is successful, the blue light will always be on.The set up process is fairly self explanatory, but MPOW has decided to use &#8220;MPOW&#8221; as the name for all of their Bluetooth products, whether that would be their FM Transmitter or Speaker. By naming all their Bluetooth names &#8220;MPOW&#8221;, returning customers will be frustrated by choosing the wrong device.&#9654; TestingI tested this product with my Sony surround sound system via the included 3.5mm auxiliary port. I was able to successfully able to pair and play music or any other audio with ease. The surround sound system was capable of playing very clear acoustics and bass without any hindrances. I was very impressed that this device was able to play audio so clearly.&#9654; Final ThoughtsAs said in testing, this device played all music and audio with ease. I was very impressed by the sound quality of the device, which is why I absolutely would recommend the device and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Compact but simplistic design.+ Includes 1.5A USB port.+ Uses Bluetooth 4.0, which is the latest in power preservation and maintaining a stable connection.Cons:- MPow has decided to name all their Bluetooth products as &#8220;MPOW&#8221;, which is frustrating if you have more than one MPOW device.- Does not include &#8221; adapter, considering this product is marketed to entertainment and surround sound systems.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review."}

I really like this product but using it on a wireless connection makes it a bad experience. Channels take a while to load and you get constant buffering and I have a pretty fast network. Starting a movie on Netflix for example take about 45 seconds to load before it starts playing. By comparison my PS3 which is wired launches a netflix movie with about 2 or 3 seconds delay. I also am unable to use this to connect to my PlayOn server because it just buffers every 2 seconds making it unusable. I think I am going to return this one and dish out a few extra bucks for the XS model... as far as the channel lineup, you have the usual netflix, hulu+, Amazon, etc. Great if you like documentaries too. I also think it is the best product if music is your thing. it has Pandora, shoutcast, TuneIn, and many others. There is a lot of lame and obscure content too so you just have to weed through it all.

{"reviewerID":"A17I3V5527VGTY","reviewText":"I just bought one in April 2014 and the serial number prefix was 201307, so it contained a real RK3188, not the RK3188T. As with a lot of these devices if you are an average user you may be disappointed or discouraged. The first thing you have to do is flash a decent ROM like NEOTV or at least update to the latest factory ROM. As far as the wifi signal strength there are fixes for the older models that require you to move the antenna inside the case. This was typically required with the first models (201305 serial number prefix), but you probably will not be able to buy these any more (the 201307 model has the antenna in the right spot). I found the best way to get a good signal is to start a large file transfer from your PC and orient the MK802IV in different positions and watch the transfer rate. You can get and app like Wifi Analyzer from Google Play Store to find the best channel for your router as well. It also helps to place you router as high as possible (6 FT or higher). There's definitely a range limitation of about 20 ft. if you don't do any type of antenna mod. Just moving the antenna outside the case gives you about 5x the bandwidth. I'd give it a higher rating if I didn't have to modify the antenna! A lot of the newer mini PCs have external antennas now.As far as heat, I found you need to keep the CPU at 1.0 GHz to 1.2 GHz or it will over heat. If you go higher than that then you will need a mini USB fan or heat sync mod.There a a several Linux kernels if you want to use this as a cheap Linux server or desktop as well..."}

With that stated, here are the pros and cons, from our perspective:Pros:Beautiful displayClear beautiful soundFast operationEasily connected to a WPA2 wireless (secured) networkCons:*Web browser will not interface with banking institution...In fairness, part of this lies in the fact that my bank has not written support for Amazon's browser. However, a browser needs to meet certain specifications in order to be considered 'secure.' We are talking, after all, about our money...*Not configurable to tasteWhile I fully understand that the ads are there to compensate for a lower price, let's place some perspective on this: the price difference is $15.00. For me, that's 1\/2 an hour at work. For many, it's much more than that. What do you get, in exchange for your $15 discount? You get a lot of Amazon 'educated guesses' on what ads they think would most entice you into purchasing more products through them. I, personally, do not consider the fact that my wife cannot configure her browser as she wishes it to be, even if the extra $15 were paid.*The interface may be BASED on Android, but this is not an Android tabletThe Kindle is to tablets what Verizon is to wireless communication devices: proprietary control designed to push you toward purchasing more product controlled by the 'owner' of the operating system. Just as Verizon bastardizes the Android operating system to make sure that they are in as much control of your usage as possible, Amazon has followed suit with the Kindle and actually prevents any true customization. Again, this is not a 'Tablet PC.' This is a book reader with great display and extra features.*Purchased keyboard\/carrying case was not even recognized.I am an electronic gadgets junkie. I am also an enterprise deployment engineer for a major computer solutions provider. I can script and automate most administrative functions of of an enterprise deployment of a business computer OS installation, and make it compatible (out of the box) with multiple platforms. If I have to fumble through several screens in order to try (and fail) to connect an USB keyboard, how is the average user going to feel?*Any app you use is automatically added to your carousel.While for many people this might be a god-send, neither my wife nor I consider this a feature. We consider it a nuisance. Kindle simply wants to make far too many decisions for the consumer. We are not sheeple in this house, and are quite capable of thinking for ourselves...*Either charging or keyboard, never both.The Kindle provides only one USB (micro) port, which means you can never use an external keyboard, and be charging the unit, simultaneously. for those like my wife that don't like virtual keyboards, this is definitely a drawback. For something that is billed as being as useful as Amazon claims the Kindle to be, there are some severe limitations that prevent this unit from being classified by anything other than a glorified book reader.Summary:While the Kindle is not a bad product, in and of itself, it did not fit our needs. Neither did it fulfill our expectations (based on advertising descriptions) of a tablet PC. I have built every computer I have owned, from the motherboard up. I am not technically impaired. With the Kindle in my hands, I felt very much like I was begging for the right to make decisions for myself, and still being declined. This very well may be useful for people that do a lot of reading, but it is definitely not worth the $300 we ended up spending. It took less than an hour to decide to send this back.Perspective:It is not my desire to belittle the product. The two stars are not indicative of the product, but more how the product failed to fit our specific needs. Others may have a different experience, based on their specific needs. However, We are very solid to ourselves when we stated that the Kindle is definitely not worth the asking price."}

(I had to install the driver before my computer would recognize the 1900x1200 resolution.)Also, the CD contains much more documentation and software to make various tweaks to color and picture.  I didn't mess with these - I just installed the driver. I was really happy that the CD allowed me to install the driver without all the software (it is my employer's laptop, and they prohibit unapproved software, but drivers only are okay.)A couple of unexpected things - the touch of color case is really beautiful and glossy - a magnet for dust and fingerprints - the screen itself is matte. This surprised me as most new monitors are have a glossy screen, but it has NO impact on the picture.There are both a DVI input and a standard VGA input for the computer. The box includes cables for both, as well as cables for the audio\/video cables (the red\/blue\/green & red\/white high def cables). There are HDMI inputs on the back and side, also, but no HDMI cables. Remote control is easy to use with nice sized buttons.I was in a hurry and hooked up the monitor to the RG6 cable from my old DirecTv TIVO (not high def) and the picture is fine - I am looking forward to hooking up HD soon.  Sound was clear and plenty loud enough for a small home office.I am using the monitor for my home office - I review lots of documents, some letter sized and some legal.  I can view two legal pages side by side at more than 100 actual size, must as I had hoped.I recommend this monitor."}
{"reviewerID":"A2NW5UDW32JSV2","reviewText":"It will be hard to ever buy a \"dumb\" digital frame again after having been spoiled by the Kodak Pulse.The design is pleasing to the eye, the display seems as good as any other and the price is right.But what makes the Pulse outstanding is the brilliant way it interacts with online photo-sharing sites and its own web-based software.The Pulse's ability to pull in pictures from your Facebook account - or any of your friends - is fantastic. Everyday, can be surprised by new pictures updating you and your family and friends. If you post to Facebook, you don't have to worry about how to upload pictures to your frame or transferring them through some separate process - the Pulse monitors your feeds and brings them right in. Brilliant!You can even email photos right to the frame, or invite others to.I've had plenty of other digital picture frames, and while they're great at first, after awhile, you get bored of the same pictures. Sure, I could go hunting for the USB cable that came with the frame, hooked them up to my computer, try to figure out what software came with which frame, and load more pictures on it, but I never get around to doing it. The Pulse solves that problem by easily hooking into my already established social network.In fact, all your pictures are uploaded to Kodak's site and streamed to the frame, which makes future transfers even easier. You even control the frames functions through the website, which is much easier than trying to figure out how to use a frame's built-in controls.Add in the touchscreen and the Kodak Pulse is a no-brainer - a terrifically designed intelligent way to enjoy your pictures - and those of your family and friends. My only complaints are that a 7\" frame is small for across the room viewing, and everyone is going to want to watch this frame. I'd also like to see the ability for it to pull pictures in from more online services (I'm a SmugMug fan, myself). But those are small points - this is a fun, useful frame that you won't want to take your eyes off of."}

I cut a square hole behind my Onkyo receiver and one behind my xbox 360 and placed these fans pointing out the back. These work great.The first night I left my xbox and receiver running for a couple of hours with the entertainment center doors shut and the fans on and when I checked both components you couldn't even tell they had been running. They were cool to the touch. Before I got the fans I had to leave the doors open because both would kick their internal fans into high gear within 5 minutes and be so hot you couldn't touch them within 10 minutes.These are great for exhaust fans for an entertainment center, but I'm not sure they would work as well in an open air environment blowing on a laptop or something. They just don't put out enough air to be used in that way. Perfect for the purpose I bought them for. Just bought a third to go behind my PS3A couple of notes on the components I'm using them with. Has nothing to do with the fans. They work as intended.Xbox 360: The 360's usb's are always powered on so the fan will never switch off. This isn't a huge deal. I just plugged the fans into the front of the console and unplug when not in use.Comcast cable box: Not sure what model I have, but same issue as above. I just unplug this one at the end of the night because that is when I turn my receiver off. Receiver doesn't have a usb port or I'd use that.PS3: The PS3's usb ports work perfect for this. They power off when the PS3 is off so the fans turn on and off with the PS3. This does mean you can't charge your PS3 controllers on it unless it's on though."}

I can easily get a 40d body, 4 lenses and a flash in the main body of the bag with ample pockets for batteries, memory cards etc.  I wasn't thrilled with the velcro inside the \"lid\".  I shoot weddings and I have to make sure the bag is wide open before the ceremony starts or if I need to get into the bag it makes a relatively loud noise... or at least louder than I like to make during a ceremony.  Also there is the nice \"Canon\" on the front that can often be interpreted as \"steal me\".... but I knew that was there when I bought it.

{"reviewerID":"ASANYZD4G6690","reviewText":"When my Sony GRX-550 laptop crashed, I took it to Best Buy in Boynton Beach, Florida, and waited seven weeks while the Geek Squad -- and I do mean Geek -- decided whether to repair or replace it under a Professional Performance Plan.  SEVEN WEEKS!  All those weeks of unanswered phone calls and e-mails made me mighty mad.  When I finally got through -- by calling corporate and asking it to patch me through -- and threatened to tell my tale to local consumer reporters, the store managers miraculously and uncharacteristically made a smart move and gave me a brand spanking new Toshiba M45-S331.This machine outperforms my GRX-550 by leaps and bounds, which I guess is to be expected in a newer computer.  It has a bright screen, fast processor, plenty of memory -- 512 mb expandable to 2 gb -- dvd burner, and enough ports to satisfy the most demanding multi-tasker.  There's also a built-in wireless feature that I haven't tried yet.All that and IT'S QUIET!  I mean it's quiet.  My old Sony laptop clicked and whirred constantly.  When I was researching machines to replace it after the crash, I listened to other Sony laptops in Best Buy and found they had the same annoying habit.  I don't know exactly why my computer was so noisy -- it sounded like the hard drive was talking to itself -- but I do know that it could be heard from every room in my apartment and often appeared as the soundtrack to my worst nightmares.After several weeks of heavy use, I can tell you I'm very happy with my Toshiba M45-S331.  If it keeps on running the way it is now for the next couple of years, I will be a Toshiba loyalist.  If it doesn't, Best Buy sweetened the replacement deal with another three year Professional Performance Plan, and you'll probably be reading about another horrible ordeal trying to get them to make good on it.The only note of caution I have for buyers of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S331 is that it does not come with a parallel port, which means if you have a printer with a parallel cord, you will have to buy one with a USB end to plug it into the computer.  This could add about 20 bucks to the cost of the computer.Happy computing."}
{"reviewerID":"A1GRBCUMLCSJEL","reviewText":"Bought this camera as a Christmas Present for my Daughter-In-Law, and having read so many conflicting reviews I decided to try it out.  As most have stated, the EXR Auto Mode is useless, battery life is quite short and the camera's menu settings are user unfriendly.  If you can live with these inconveniencies you will love the quality of the photographs. For those who want a simple point and shoot, just set the EXR mode to HR, the max Auto ISO to 400 and the camera will outperform any Point & Shoot out there.  If you learn to take advantage of all the features, there isn't anything around at this price that will match its capabilities or performance. I haven't heard the click and clack noises that other people referred too, nor see any problems with the battery compartment accidently opening. I have a Canon DSLR and my wife has a Canon SD950 IS and the F200EXR out performs the SD950 in all areas.  At this website [...] you can go to, \"Compare Sample Images\" under \"Digital Cameras\" and compare test images of different cameras side by side. After you select the pictures you want to compare, click on the images to enlarge them. This is good way to check out some of the claims; my old XXXXX camera was better"}
{"reviewerID":"A1G29MRK4U08F1","reviewText":"This is a perfect laser printer for home or home office with moderate to slightly heavy printing needs. I'm not sure how it would hold up to the volumes of a regular office.Pros:1. By far the cheapest and easiest laser toner to refill. Just twist the knob and pour in the refill. $8 for up to 3500 pages. Just do it inside a large plastic bag to prevent spills, keep your nose covered, and have plenty of paper towels to clean up the outside of the toner once done. Takes about 10 minutes in total and requires no special skills.2. Good quality scans. Not amazing, but I do a lot of document scanning for work and it works great. I do miss the ADF and I plan to upgrade to the KX-MB2010.3. Small, Lightweight and easy to move with finger holds on both sides. Small footprint for a laser printer.4. Connects both via USB and ethernet. For wireless connectivity you will need a bridge. You can get a TP-LINK nano bridge for about $20.5. Scan to file function on the printer automatically writes either an image or pdf (whichever you choose) to your documents folder, so you can do multiple scans right from the printer without having to make repeated trips back to the PC. However this function does not work on Windows 8, which I'm guessing is a firewall issue which I haven't gotten around yet. The feature worked flawlessly on XP and Windows 7. In Windows 8, you can still either use Windows Scan or the bundled software to initiate scans and they work fine.6. Printer does auto-maintenance every 24 hours, which is great for a home or home-office when several days can go with no prints. I've had it for 2.5 years now and its still going strong with no issues.7. Though its not obvious from the pictures, there is a manual feed at the back of the printer as well, which is useful for duplex printing.8. No paper jams yet in 2.5 years of use. If you do have a jam, its easy to clear.9. Print quality for documents remains excellent despite using aftermarket toner refills.Cons:1. No ADF. When I first bought it, my document scanning needs weren't as high as they are now, so I didn't miss it then.2. Starter toner only yields about 500 prints. More than makes up for this with the cheap refill cost. You can refill the starter toner to get it up to 2000 prints, which is good for me for a year.3. No wireless, but a $20 bridge will fix this if you need it.4. Not the quietest printer\/scanner. You can't print\/scan if you have someone sleeping in the same room, but it won't wake up anyone in an adjacent room either.5. No automatic duplex printing, which I don't expect for this size anyway.6. Paper tray does not slide out smoothly and does not hold a full ream. It takes about 300 sheets at a time, which is plenty for home use. I just don't like leaving half-reams lying around.7. Requires a driver install. Some printers work with generic drivers or are included in the windows driver database. This is not one of them. The driver install is easy enough and the setup files are easy to find on Panasonic's website, but I do have a work laptop on which I am not the administrator and I cannot use it with this printer.Overall, given how cheap and easy it is to refill the toner on this printer, its an amazing value. I have switched computers 4 times so far and had no trouble setting it up each time."}

Now that I've had the antenna for a couple of months, I'm beginning to experience the same problem but with different stations. It could be the broadcasters themself with the switch to digital but all the broadcast stations are within a 10 mile ratious of my locations.The installation was simple. I took down my existing antenna, leaving the pole, and mounted the Winegard antenna to the existing pole (it would be nice if Winegard provided a mounting pole with their antenna as did my old antenna) and connection it to the existing cable. Nothing to it. But then again, I followed the same procedure installing my old antenna.To sum up, the antenna worked great when I first received it but it's performance is degrading with time."}

{"reviewerID":"A3IXXWSTNWCS4G","reviewText":"50mm becomes 80mm on the Rebel XT. If that's the focal length you're after, great. I find it a little too long for what I normally shoot.Overall, it takes some very nice shots. I use this in churches that don't allow flash or tripods. It has saved me on more than a few occasions. Since it is a fixed focal length you have to crop your images afterwards to get the framing you really wanted. (Sometimes it is physically impossible to move to the position you need to be in to get the shot you want)It is soft wide open but starts to get very sharp from 2.8. Auto focus is pretty much useless in very low light. You have to switch to manual for these situations. One thing I don't like is that you cannot focus manually while auto focus is set to auto.One big plus is the lens is extremely small and light weight. Coupled with a Rebel XT you hardly feel like you are carrying anything around your neck.If you normally use zooms you will have to get in the habit of moving closer and farther from your subject. Your feet are now your zoom.Another big plus, it is only 80 bucks!!! If you are on a tight budget you can be getting great shots while you are saving for an L lens.Check out the pics I uploaded if you want to see unedited examples of what this lens can do."}

He was on the C Crane site himself, and I went back and forth between the two to better understand what might be included, features, etc.  We ordered them and had them within 2 days as promised (products gotten directly from Amazon have always come on time and with no problems!).Anyhow, with mostly grown children we're always looking for something they don't have that might be neat, and ended up ordering one for most of the adults on our Christmas list, plus one for us.  Since I wouldn't let him have his Christmas gift early, we opened up the one we ordered for our house (I love it so much I want to call it mine!).  First thing we did was check for hubby's favorite AM radio station - it doesn't come in on ANY of the radios in our house and he can only listen to it in the car (which often makes him a little cranky).  Had no trouble finding it and got clear reception.Since we just opened the box, I gave it a few cranks since it was \"just a try\" - didn't bother reading the directions, never read about the 90 seconds.  I think I cranked it maybe ten at most.  I then left hubby to listen to his program and went upstairs.The radio was still playing three hours later.  Maybe I just got lucky - I've never seen any hand-crank emergency device last more than about ten minutes on a good cranking before, and had expected this was something that I would have to crank repeatedly to have any kind of volume or reception.  The amount of life on their \"dynamo\" option has left me absolutely FLOORED.  Wow.We ordered all three colors, with most blue since the blue was slightly cheaper (and I think it's a cute color, anyhow).  Absolutely thrilled by this, and considering whether or not I want to get one for my sister in Houston - when they had the hurricane I didn't hear from her for almost two weeks after her initial \"I didn't die in the hurricane\" message and her excuse was that with no power she couldn't charge her cell phone, even though cell service was available.  Hopefully she'd have a phone that would fit the charger adapters (5) that come with it.  Haven't checked to see if it fits ours yet.I would heartily recommend this to anyone.  Compared to the emergency radios I find available in retail, this one beats all of them, hands down.Oh - one more thing.  We finally turned it off to watch television.  I turned it on without cranking the next day with no problems...  :-)"}

It worked great - but the maximum number of phone numbers to be blocked was 80 numbers - which was maxed out fast over the past year. The scammers use multiple numbers and change them frequently - so it was easy to fill all 80 slots.THIS CPR call blocker has a maximum of 1000 numbers!!! (Plus 200 per-programmed known offenders.) Hopefully I never reach this limit LOL!CPR call blocker works great on my plain old telephone landline. Very easy to set up. One button to block calls while they are happening. There is no display - but it is real easy to program numbers to be blocked using your telephone as key pad. For example - to block a number just lift handset and hit #7**, wait for beep, then enter the number to be blocked,  followed by #, then hangup. Could not be any easier.Also - it gets power from the phone line itself - so no power cord - nice and clean install.Highly recommend.  With PRIME shipping - arrived the within two days of placing order.EDIT:  I mistyped above - one should be enter \"* * 7 # (beep) NUMBER # (beep)\" on your phone's dial if you want to manually add a specific number that you want to block - e.g. your spurned ex GF."}

{"reviewerID":"AK6FTDBW6WCLC","reviewText":"(Prior to my 11-27-13 update.) I got extremely lucky and bought two of these (one in red, one in purple) for 1 cent a piece, plus $4.99 shipping and handling each. This new design has 2 protective end covers - a new feature from the previous models. I find the CaseCrown cases, overall, to be of impeccable design and I have never been disappointed with any I have bought. I have purchased assorted cases for my Kindle eReaders (various generations) and for my Kindle Fire Tablets. I hope CaseCrown continues to design cases\/covers for future Amazon Kindle Readers and Tablets.(Update of 11-27-13) I recently received my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet. When I pre-ordered my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet, I also ordered 2 CaseCrown Bold Standby Pro Cases and this Fintie Folio Case Slim Fit. While the CaseCrown seems to be of a sturdier, heavier design, the materials are not as aesthetically pleasing as those in the Fintie. There is more of a leather look and feel to the Fintie.In comparing the Red CaseCrown cover to the Fintie, I noticed there is more open area in the display window area of the Fintie; there is an opening over the microphone in the Fintie - in the CaseCrown, the microphone is covered; there is a stylus loop in the Fintie (stylus not included); there are cut-outs on the Fintie case's back cover directly over the speakers (on the CaseCrown, there are openings on the side, near the speakers) and finally, in the frame of the Fintie's window display, there are cutouts to allow easier swiping of the menus - there are none in the CaseCrown.Bonuses for the CaseCrown, when you bend the face of the cover back, like a book, there are magnets (front and back) that secure it to the backside of the case - a very nice touch. CaseCrown also has the hand strap on the inside of the cover that you can use to get a good grip on the case when it is held open like a book. Overall, the CaseCrown case\/cover is of sturdier, seemingly longer lasting design, while the Fintie has more of the leather look and is lighter in the hand.UPDATED (12-03-13) Well, go figure! I just slipped my Kindle Fire 7\" HDX into the Purple CaseCrown cover and discovered it is completely different than the Red CaseCrown cover I purchased at the same time - both for the Kindle Fire 7\" HDX. This one has the wonderful features that the Fintie has, plus all the excellent features the best CaseCrown covers have. I am now guessing the red cover they shipped was for a different model of the Kindle Fire 7\". I wish I had noticed this at the time I received them. I just assumed they were the same product, as I had bought them as such and my \"Your Orders\" shows them as being the same Case Crown Cover model (specifically for the Kindle Fire 7\" HDX) just different colors.(UPDATE 12-04-13) Last night, I emailed Senyx, the company selling the case (fulfilled by Amazon) and described what I had discovered regarding the completely different cases\/covers, both sold as solely for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\". I received a swift response this morning and Senyx is replacing the red case with the case designed solely for the Kindle Fire HDX 7\". I should get it within 3 to 5 business days. Now that is great PR for their company and speaks highly of their desire to present their patrons with a quality product and buyer-friendly service. Two thumbs up!(UPDATE 12-06-13) Argh! Gawh! Well, they shipped the \"replacement\" free of charge and as soon as I received it I opened it up to have a look. Well, it is identical to the one I got before. The same issues are present: In comparing the Red CaseCrown cover to the Fintie, I noticed there is more open area in the display window area of the Fintie; there is an opening over the microphone in the Fintie - in the CaseCrown, the microphone is covered; there is a stylus loop in the Fintie (stylus not included); there are cut-outs on the Fintie case's back cover directly over the speakers (on the CaseCrown, there are openings on the side, near the speakers) and finally, in the frame of the Fintie's window display, there are cutouts to allow easier swiping of the menus - there are none in the CaseCrown.So, if you should order one in red, you might get a case for the wrong model - FYI, buyer beware."}

These are truly outstanding in-ear headphones, leaps and bounds ahead of the cheap knockoffs or those irksome little earphones that IPods come with. Having burned through a half dozen pairs of the cheapies in the last year, I was greatly impressed with these because:1) The sound quality is really wonderful. The base is powerful; the highs are undistorted even at high volume.2) They are very comfortable. They come with the three sets of plastic covers that appear to be industry standard, but one set or another will fit just about any ear.3) The cords and connectors are sturdy; only time will tell if they hold up as long as they appear likely to do.Two minor negatives:1) The amount of noise limiting is, well, limited. Ambient noise seeps through and the volume needs to be a bit higher than one might wish for.2) The packaging is that awful molded plastic which is designed never to open w\/o major efforts.The plusses far outweigh the negatives. A strong \"buy\" recommendation."}

The connector and strain relief are about 1-1\/2 inches long - too long for my application. When I prepared the cable for installing a typical crimped &#34;F&#34; connector, I found that the cable's shield was very sparsely braided. There was hardly any wire to bend back; certainly, not enough to give good uniform coverage. Installing the new connector was challenging. There isn't much solid material to crimp. After a couple of tries, I got it done. My recommendation is if you think you'll cut this to length and install another connector, look elsewhere for a cable with a better quality braid. Otherwise, it should be OK."}

I say one of, because it doesn't do everything I need it do, nor is it reasonable to expect it to do so.  A good camera bag is determined as much by the task it is being used for as it is the quality of the bag itself.  For instance, this isn't a bag I would use on a hiking trip, I much prefer a backpack for that.  This bag also doesn't have a dedicated tablet or laptop compartment (though I can stick my nexus in here with no problem.To me, this is a bag that is meant for photography.  You may be saying that since this is a camera bag that is rather obvious, but let me elaborate.  This is the bag when I'm going to take pictures, not take pictures and worry about editing (where I need a laptop) or a bag for a hike where I might take pictures.  This is a bag for when the big goal of what I'm going to be doing is photography.  It lets me carry an organize a large amount of photo equipment, easily access it and know that its stored in a safe, padded bag the entire time.All in all, a great camera bag so long as its features align to your needs."}

{"reviewerID":"A3C3VITIMY0DJJ","reviewText":"This was my second digital camera I've ever used.  My first was a Samsung SDC-80, which was a bit of a disspointment, yet there were still some good uses for if used correctly.  Almost the same applies to the DSC-P51 in my opinion. The first 10 shots I took appeared fuzzy, mainly because I couldn't feel the \"half-clicks\" as there are in most other Point-and-Shoot cameras. Later, I found out where the \"half-click\" point was, and from then on, I got amazingly good focus.The twilight mode is ok. It requires a second or two's worth of time to acquire and capture the images though, so you better have a tripod or really steady hands if you don't want blurry pictures.  The camera seems excessively sensitive to light sources than most other cameras I've used, and the entire picture will go dark if there's any \"sunny spot\" or other bright spots on the picture.  In general, if done right, you get perfect pictures.  If there's a slight error, you might end up with a dark or blurry picture.The worst thing about the camera is the JPEG compression.  Of course I don't expect it to save in TIFF or uncompressed mode (1600x1200x24bit = 5.49MB\/shot) on ... Memory Sticks, but none of the pictures look \"picture perfect\" at 100% view due to the artifacts from JPEG compression.  Hence why I have to either resize my pictures to 1024x768 or crop to 1500x1200 and reduce to 1280x1024 for my 17\" monitor.  A pain that I will always have to put up with, but ok for those who just want to print on photo media.All that aside, this is a really good 2MP camera for the price it goes for. It's loaded with features that I haven't even gotten around to using yet, and with 3 hours of battery time, I'm loving it.  I'd recommend the camera to anyone who is a veteran of digital photography and know how digital cameras work.  Even if you're not, it's an ok camera to start out with, but don't expect to get good pictures first try - takes a lot of practice.  But after you get the hang of it, the camera is definitely worth the money."}

{"reviewerID":"A1MUJXG8MJW36C","reviewText":"This lens is a bit of a splurge for me. But, I really needed a good wide angle zoom. I have a Canon 5D and after researching this appeared to be the one to get for a full frame Canon. I would have liked a little more on the wide end, but this was the best quality option. I do think the Nikon 14-24 might be a more sensible range in some ways, but I have also found that being able to zoom up to 35mm without having to change lenses is really  a nice and useful feature. In other words, the extra 11mm on the long end really comes in handy. A lot of days, and certainly shoots, I never change lenses.I read a few reviews that stated this lens was a little soft at the edges. My lens is razor sharp edge to edge, and I have not yet noticed any softness in any situation. One more thing, some reviews also say you need slimline filters to prevent vignetting. The only time I had a problem with that was when I forgot to remove my UV filter and stacked a polarizer on top of it. Otherwise, normal thickness filters should not be a problem."}

{"reviewerID":"A30NNLD0AT6J8T","reviewText":"This a slick little \"netbook\" computer.  Obviously there are LOTS of reviews to weed through.  My personal feeling is that some people rate a product on their emotional purchase rather than practical purchase feelings.  They don't want to feel like they bought something bad.  Now I am not saying this is a bad \"netbook\".  But it is just that, a \"netbook\" with limited abilities and true functionality.I bought mine to check email, run simple non-graphic or memory intensive programs on trips, and run some basic media type stuff.  Here is what I found while using it.Pros: I can run Microsoft Image Suite 9 and edit some pictures and stuff that I back up to it while on trips.  Comes with XP! It has a really nice battery life which is great for long flights.  A spare (or two) battery and you are set for all but the longest flights.  160GB hard drive is pretty roomy.  Add an external USB drive and you can do just about anything you want and bring anything you want.  Well made.  Nice looking.  Decent speed (I upgraded to 2GB memory).  Great for email and surfing the web from a hotel room.  Is exactly what I expect a netbook to be.Cons:  Obviously small screen.  Obviously small keyboard.  If you have large hands typing can be somewhat of a chore.  No multi-card drive other than SD.  Obviously with no CD\/DVD drive loading programs can be a chore.  Have to buy external drive for loading stuff not available over internet or Wi-Fi.  Won't run iTunes unless hooked up to AC power (at least mine won't run iTunes on battery no matter what settings I chose).

It seems every 3 years or less, they come out with a new system that won't work on the computer you already bought. Making the computer look like a cute little lamp that has a movable monitor is a good gimmick, but what is missing are the basics:1.) There is a major lack of software for this system. There is virtually one file sharing software that works with it called Limewire which crashes all the time. Kazaa and Bearshare don't have Mac versions of their software so you basically can't download songs, etc.2.) The processors are slow...Only 800 mhz...PCs are over twice as fast. For this price you could get a 2.2 ghz PC.3.) The price! You could buy a Windows machine with 512 megs of ram for less than the price of this gimmicky clunker.4.) The reason to buy an Apple computer now is gone...Ease of use. The new system OSX is a nightmare. It's not the Mac you have grown to love if you have used Macs in the past.5.) Nobody else uses them....There is little compatibility with the majority of computer users. Even Microsoft Office files don't translate properly on the Mac. I'm talking about the same version number!6.) Upgrades to the available software lags way behind PC upgrades. Example: AOL 5.0 was the version I used on my Mac. All of my friends were using 7.0.

So I decided to buy this generic one to try it out. The connection was not as reliable; sometimes I would have to try 2 or 3 times before the iPad recognized this card reader. But for the money, I had no complaints that I had to sometimes re-insert this thing to get it to work.My main gripe is in the speed. This problem is not just with this generic item but also on the OEM Apple item. If the SD card has a LOT of pictures (say 800 JPGs that are 2 MB each), then it becomes nearly impossible to navigate through the pictures to select the ones to upload. The iPad needs to create a thumbnail for each picture so that you can view the pictures on the iPad. For the iPad to show the thumbnails, it will take several seconds for each page of thumbnails. To scroll 40-50 pages to find the picture that you want to upload could take 15-20 minutes. This might be a design flaw since the $29 Apple item also exhibits this behavior. If you only have 20-30 pictures on your SD card, then this is not a problem. But if you have hundreds of pictures on the SD card, then good luck navigating through all your pics."}

So I only carry my SlingShot 300 AW if I really need to tote the extra amount of gear inside it.This review is entirely written from the perspective of looking at what Lowepro improved upon compared to their original SlingShot 200 AW model.  I have also uploaded 7 fully-annotated images to the 'View and share related images' Customer Images gallery that describe the side-by-side differences between the older SlingShot 200 and new SlingShot 202 models.I noticed that Amazon currently still offers both the older SlingShot 200 AW model and the newer updated 202 AW model for about the same price.  If both are similarly priced, get this 202 AW instead of the older-model 200 AW.  If you currently have a Lowepro SlingShot 200 AW that is showing its wear after years of usage and wonder about switching to the new version, this updated 202 model offers a number of incremental improvements, but this is not a radical redesign of the 200 model, and that is a good thing since the original SlingShot 200 AW was quite good to begin with.While the well-padded sling that goes diagonally across the back of the bag can be hung over your left shoulder so that the bag loosely rests on your left shoulder blade, it is designed to be primarily worn by slipping both your head and left arm through the sling so that the sling comes over your right shoulder, goes diagonally down the front of your body, and connects to the bag behind the left side of your abdomen.  Once the bag is slung onto your back, a smaller strap coming from the bottom-right of your abdomen clasps onto the sling in the front at chest level to further prevent shifting of the bag.One main advantage of this sling design is that you can conveniently access the bag's contents by unclasping the smaller strap and rotating the sling clockwise around your neck to bring the bag from behind your left side until it rests on your abdomen.  With the bag slung in front of you, you can now unzip the main compartment's lid, and you can proceed to change cameras, lenses, memory cards, batteries, or access other supplies.  I have made changes to my camera before while still slowly walking with the backpack slung on my abdomen as the top-facing part of the bag can be used as a platform to rest the camera body upon.This sling bag provides quicker ease of access to your gear by allowing you to swivel the bag from your back to your front, whereas you have to fully take a backpack off to access your gear.  This convenience feature does not only apply to when you are standing up, but if you travel as much as I do, you will find this ability to quickly swivel the bag to the front is also advantageous when frequently getting on and off buses, subways, and trains.  When I get onto a bus, subway, or train, I quickly swivel my SlingShot around to the front so that it rests on my lap while I am sitting down.  And when I get off the bus, the sling bag swivels just as quickly onto my back again.  This is less cumbersome than taking a backpack's straps off your shoulders, placing the backpack on your lap or the floor during the bus ride, and then looping the backpack's straps onto your shoulders again when you get off the bus.However, some people, notably women, may not like how the sling strap and second smaller strap tighten diagonally across the chest area.  So these sling bag configurations will not be comfortable for everyone, especially since a fully-loaded sling backpack can pull on the entire chest area with its frontal diagonal straps.  The load that is exerted onto your chest depends upon how much weight you are carrying inside the sling bag.  With one camera body and one lens in the sling bag, you may be okay; but once you start adding extra lenses, flash, and other gear, your discomfort may increase.  As is also the case with how different backpacks may fit you with different levels of comfort, whether you find this sling bag's diagonal sling to be comfortable on your chest may ultimately be an important deciding factor in your purchasing decision.  If you frequently carry a \"messenger bag\" style of laptop bag (e.g. Timbuk2 laptop messenger bags) fully loaded with laptop and books, usually worn with its strap going diagonally across your chest, you should be okay with how this SlingShot feels.Both the SlingShot 200 and 202 models can carry both my Canon 7D with attached 17-55mm f\/2.8 lens and Canon 40D with attached 70-200mm f\/4L lens (with hoods reversed and no battery grip).  Basically, to convert this from a one-camera SlingShot to a two-camera setup, you rotate both cameras 90 degrees and rearrange the dividers on the bottom of the bag.  I added an image to the 'View and share related images' Customer Images gallery if you want to see what this looks like.  Unlike a regular backpack that uses shoulder straps, the front diagonal straps do exert more pressure on your chest as you load up more weight inside the sling bag, so you may not find this comfortable for carrying two cameras.  While I would not go on a 6-hour walking tour of a city always carrying both cameras inside my SlingShot, I may initially head out with both cameras stored inside and keep them stored as I get into cars\/buses\/airplanes.  And then once I am walking about, I will take out the 17-55mm camera, leaving the 70-200mm camera inside, ready for use.By far, the most important improvement in the new SlingShot 202, compared with the old 200 model, is the addition of the tripod buckle, cinch strap, and hideaway foldout tripod feet pouch on the side of the 202's bag.  On the 200, you had 3 SlipLock Attachment Loops, 2 on the back and 1 on the side, that you could use to sort of carry a tripod or monopod, but I never felt like it securely held my tripod in place.  But now with the cinch strap and foldout tripod feet pocket that holds the bottom of the tripod\/monopod, this is a far more secure and neater configuration for carrying a tripod.  The tripod feet pocket is about 2.5 inches deep.  So you insert your tripod feet into this pouch and then buckle and tighten the top cinch strap.  A 22 or 24 inch long tripod feels balanced and secure when I carry the Slingshot on my back.  When I swing the bag to the front of my chest, the tripod is then positioned underneath the bag and it does not feel very loose because, most importantly, I tighten the top cinch strap very tight.  However, I really wished that Lowepro made this pouch deeper.  A tripod feet pocket that is 3.5 or 4.0 inches deep would have given a more secure fit to hold the bottom feet of the tripod.The 202 is a little more boxy and rigid than the previous 200 model.  You can set the 202 down on the ground or on a table in an upright position and it will stay standing upright by itself.  The bottom of the 200 was not as flat and could sometimes flop forward or backward if you tried to stand it upright on a flat surface.The SlingShot 202 has an extra zippered pocket in the top compartment's zippered flap for extra separate storage space.  In adding this pocket, the SlipLock Attachment Loop that used to be attached to the 200's top compartment's zippered flap is no longer there on the 202.  On the inside of the 202's top compartment's zippered flap, there is yet another zippered pocket, along with an elastic band for securely holding an item.  The top compartment on the 202 is also more roomier compared with the 200.The soft microfiber protective LCD monitor cloth has been repositioned from being sewn into the center edge of the main compartment's opening on the SlingShot 200, and is now moved over to the left edge of the main compartment's opening (on the left side when viewed from the perspective of having the bag slung in front of you and looking down into the main compartment's cavity).  This is nice in that the cloth flap does not get in the way as much when you are accessing the camera.  In both the 200 and 202, there is an elastic mesh pocket that can store the LCD monitor cloth if you want to tuck it away.I also have theLowepro Magnum 200 AW Shoulder Bag (Black), which is another excellent quality bag from Lowepro, and on that bag the microfiber protective LCD monitor cloth is attached to the inside wall of the bag using Velcro so that you can move the cloth to wherever you want it.  In addition, having a removable and relocatable LCD monitor cloth not only gives you flexibility in placement of the cloth, but also makes it far easier to wash the cloth if it gets dirty.  But on all of the first-generation and second-generation SlingShot models, this cloth is permanently sewn into the bag and you cannot move or remove it.  I would have MUCH preferred that this cloth was attached using Velcro the way that Lowepro's Magnum 200 AW was designed!On the inside lid of the main compartment, the 202 has two Velcro-closure memory card pockets.  But on the older SlingShot 200 model, there was actually a single larger Velcro-closure pocket and inside that main pocket were 8 separate elastic pockets for holding memory cards.  This is the only feature that I thought was actually better on the old 200 model compared with the new 202 bag, and I wish that Lowepro had retained the 200 bag's inside lid pocket and also used it on the 202 bag.  On the old 200 bag, this inside lid pocket could hold more CompactFlash cards compared with the 202 bag's two memory card pockets.  The only advantage that I can see for this redesign is that the two separate memory card pouches hold the cards more securely compared with opening up a larger pocket that stored more memory cards inside it.  But I still like the older pocket better!&#3051; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:To summarize, in comparing this SlingShot 202 AW to the previous SlingShot 200 AW bag, the top compartment area's storage space was increased by adding two zippered pockets to the top compartment's zippered flap, and the top compartment, in general, is a bit larger.  The microfiber LCD monitor cloth was repositioned to move it out of the way more when accessing the camera.  And the inside lid's memory card pockets were redesigned.  But the most compelling reason to upgrade from a SlingShot 200 AW to this SlingShot 202 AW is the tripod strap and foot pouch on the side of the 202.  These differences between the 200 and 202 are better displayed and described on the 8 images that I added to the 'View and share related images' Customer Images gallery.  Overall, these are evolutionary, not revolutionary, improvements to an already-great sling bag!"}

While the 10 - yes ten - times optical zoom just makes it a nice choice for the lazy Sports pro photographer as well.I took close ups of a tub of odds and ends, pencils old screwdrivers and other rubbish. Then I enlarged until the definition ( 'grain' in old camera speak ) began to fuzz. Unbelievable results after the edit printed on everday 6x4 HP stock and at normal resolution on a HP AIO printer.Haven't tried the landscape mode yet, but indoors portrait shots on Auto range\/focus etc., came out superb as well. In addition the flash on auto does a great job, no need to tinker with that either. Movies work fine but with some care not to move the camera around too much when recording.You must get at least a 1 G SD ram card ( we got a 2gig Sandisk on sale at Circuit City for $34 ) with this model. At full resolution you'll get but 12 shots with the internal 32 meg. With the 2 Gig memory card the camera will take 907, yes that is nine hundred and seven, pictures.A person would be nutz not to buy this Kodak if they are looking for simplicty of use but want a professional print."}

{"reviewerID":"A1ODOGXEYECQQ8","reviewText":"The BBH-200 is a high quality ball head.  It features a knob lock wheel for a quick release of your DSLR.  It came with a quick shoe pad that you can screw in at bottom of your camera for quick docking.  The quick shoe has non-slip rubber paddings to make sure it won't damage or scratch the bottom of your camera.  The quick shoe has a safety pin feature to prevent your camera from falling down if you loosen up the knob - this works as long as you don't loosen up the quick shoe all the way.The Main Lock which is the biggest knob controls the ball.  One twist to release and to lock.  This will be the knob that you will be using the most.  You can spin the camera 360 degrees as well as tilt up and down.  This will also allow you to switch from landscape to portrait and back.One big feature here is the Rapid Leveling switch.  Pushing  the switch to the right will quickly lock your camera into horizontal position.You also get two bubble levels, one for landscape and one for the portrait mode.At 44-lb capacity, it will have no problem supporting a DSLR or a good size video camera.Overall, the BBH-200 is a very solid product.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes."}
{"reviewerID":"A2DBQZJ9E5N9PQ","reviewText":"Let me start by saying the only reason I bought these speakers was because the audio jack on my computer is broken so I am forced to use speakers that have sound going through a USB cord. Unfortunately, there's not much of a selection for USB speakers that are suitable for using with a desktop PC and this is one of the few I could find.As other reviewers have pointed out, the volume adjustment with these things are really bad. Setting the volume on the lowest possible setting will be too loud, put it one bar lower and the sound is off. This is the main reason why I gave these speakers 2 stars. Also, no volume control dial and no headphone jack. On the other hand, the sound quality is surprisingly good for $10 speakers.These speakers are extremely small, much more smaller than the picture would suggest, and they look almost comical next to my 22-inch monitor. As I said before, I only bought these speakers because the sound goes through USB and my audio jack is broken. If you don't need sound to go through USB, I suggest you look elsewhere, as nearly every other speaker system is better than these."}

{"reviewerID":"A32FL8K77UAEN8","reviewText":"First and foremost. Order a couple extra batteries.  Small size = less battery life.  Here is the genuine retail packaged one from amazon with a great price.B000WTWLHOThat being said....Q system was obviously designed with future in mind: it started as an idea that sensor tech will become so advanced in time that the size and bulk of the system will become a crucial differentiator in choosing a camera and lenses when people intend to enjoy photography more and on more regular basis.Thus an aspect of the Q system camera I particularly like is this: a Q7 camera body, together with all 7 lenses issued to far, weighs only: 499 grams. Add 30 grams for two batteries and a card, and you have a capable entire system that weighs less than many entry level DSLR bodies alone and costs about the medium level DSLR body alone.They say the best camera is one you have with you. That's why many use smartphones today as their cameras. But Q has a seriously better image quality, the feel and responsiveness than any smartphone, it's not a joke.We can extend previous thought and say the best camera system is one you can take with you all the time. An ad Olympus posted on your website says DSLRs are left at home 92% of the time. Well, to answer that, a Q camera and three lenses are always with me! And that whole package is smaller and lighter even than my DSLR body alone!Seriously, just 500 grams for the entire 7 lens system, and so small it can fit in a small purse, means less burden, constant companion on all trips without pick and choose, more photographs taken, more engagement with a properly designed photographic tool -- which Q really is.Because that's another aspect of the Q I believe most users like: it feels like a proper, engaging photographer's tool, despite its miniature size (it can fit in the palm). I encourages experimentation, and looking outside the box. We become better photographers not by constantly buying new cameras, but by continuously using the same camera and focusing on art of image taking."}

They work just as well if not better than the Canon brand.  I've had a set for a couple years now and never had a problem with them.  The original Canon BP-819, on the other hand, stopped taking a charge after about a year.  So I went ahead and bought another set of Wasabi Power batteries.  So now I have 4 of them, all for about what I paid for the one Canon brand.I recently bought a Vixia HF G20, and these work just as well in it.  For some things, like conversion lenses, it pays to go with the manufacturer.  But in this case, there's absolutely no reason to pay for an official Canon BP-819 as long as Wasabi Power keeps making these."}

{"reviewerID":"A3JHC8O59WDHFZ","reviewText":"I'm pretty good with computers. I know they don't always act quite the way we'd like, but having spent most of my life, and all of my professional career, using them well beyond word processing, i've learned my way around pretty well.Setting up this frame was infuriating.The first problem was that i have my wireless router set up with mac address filtering. The frame walks you through setting up the wireless, but nowhere in the process does it offer you the mac address. After half an hour of trying to find the manual online, i eventually tracked one down through some shady third-party site. This told me at least what button to look for. Of course, by then some sort of screen saver had kicked in on the frame. When i tapped it, it woke up enough to tell me that all of the on-screen buttons were disabled, but no suggestion of how to re-enable them. Annoyed, i hit the power button instead, then fired it back up. At that point i was able to track down the button that would tell me the mac address so that i could re-start the set-up process to actually get it to talk to my router. Way, way too hard. (I am aware that many users will not have mac address filtering, and thus not have this exact problem, but it's a good example of kodak's reckless disregard for its users.)Once you somehow get the frame to talk to the internet, you're then sent to your computer to do the rest of the set-up online. It encourages you to set up an account on kodak's website, but doesn't make it terribly easy to skip that step. All the fight in me had been used up just finding the mac address, so i went along and made an account. In contrast to the frame, the kodak pulse website is actually pretty well done.Again, i had to skip a bunch of steps, because i didn't want to link my frame to anyone's facebook page, nor did i want to set up an email address to which anyone could send pictures. (There's no passcode or anything, so any nefarious person can code a little program that sends pictures to random email addresses under the kodak pulse domain. It's probably only a matter of time until people start getting lewd pictures appearing on their frames.)Those steps skipped, you get to actually upload pictures. Again, this UI is pretty good, and pretty easy. Assuming you know where on your computer you have the images saved, it's a matter of a few clicks to upload them.A few more clicks and you can get to the settings page, so you can control such things as how long the images stay on the frame before going to the next (though your choices are limited to 3 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and 30 minutes, plus an unexplained 'smart' setting). One awesome option is the energy saving settings, which let you set an on and off time for the frame. It would be even more awesome if it allowed more than one block (for example, you can set it to turn on at 8am and off and 10pm, but you can't set it to be on from 6am to 8am, and then 6pm to 10pm, so that you have pictures before work and after work, but the frame isn't on while you're out and while you're asleep).You can also upload pictures directly from a memory card\/stick to the frame, but here you get back to the utterly horrific frame UI. (Did i mention that you have to type in your wireless router password every time it connects, but the on-screen keyboard is alphabetic instead of qwerty? If you're not a computer user, you're not going to be connecting to a router, and if you are a computer user, you'll find it nigh on impossible to type on an abcde keyboard.)If you want the frame to just play a slideshow of the pictures on the memory device, great, because that's what it'll do without asking. If you want to upload the pictures onto the frame, that requires jumping through flaming hoops. Once you can even decrypt the pictograms that serve as buttons (no helper text, that would make it too easy), you get the option to upload the current picture or all pictures on the memory device. Again, allowing the user to select a subset would be just too easy, or too useful.Once you finally slog through the set-up, the picture quality is pretty good. The default brightness is perfect, the colors are true, and it just plain looks good....until it transitions to the next picture. The website gives you a bunch of pre-set options for how long pictures should display, but you can't independently select how the photos transition. If you want the pictures up for 3 seconds, it can do a wipe transition, but at 30 seconds your only option is fade. Which would be fine, except the fade is more of a sickly-flicker.And, lastly, if you upload a portrait-oriented picture, it just shows it with big black rectangles on the sides. There's no (apparent) way to either tell it to fill the frame, or to select which part of the picture to show.So... if you can make it through the set-up, and don't mind the flicker between pictures, and have only landscape-oriented photos, you'll love this frame. Oh, and don't mind that there's no battery option, so it always has to be plugged in.(Edited to add: i had no compatibility issues with my MacBook. All the troubles i had were entirely within the kodak frame's UI or product presets.)"}

I hate units that I have to be sure to have their special battery charged, just in case I'll need it on that day's shoots... but this works off of my normal AA's that I always have a ton of for flash anyway, and the best part is that it accepts the larger video battery that my Fotodiox 500 LED uses. The Fotodiox works off of two, so when I am on an LED only shoot, I can always steal one batter from the Fotodiox and easily power the Chromo 160.

I was able to offload the critical files and I am now convinced that the problem was not the drive at all and that we may be able to put the drive back in the computer when it comes back from Dell and pick up where we left off..Curiously the adapter came in a plain brown box with no labeling and there were no instructions although there was really no need for any instructions."}

This RAM works perfectly on my system and in this price its definitely a steal. Even though it has higher specifications but it auto adjusts to PC-1333 and 1.5v instead of 1.65v as mentioned in its XMP spec. Looking forward to get 12GB more."}

{"reviewerID":"A35X2JJI49OBZP","reviewText":"This is an OK player.  It's main selling points are that it's tiny and inexpensive.  That said, you get what you pay for.The pros:- it's so light that you almost won't notice it.- as of this point in time, it's under $30.- it holds a lot of music (I didn't try photos)- the picture quality is clear (it comes with samples)- music can be added by dragging and dropping - no proprietary software!!  Add a star.- the video quality is OK (again, there are samples, but video on a 1 inch screen?)- the instruction sheet seems pretty clear, and it comes in English, Spanish, French, and German.The cons:- it's got the hard ear buds - I have tiny ears and these buds don't fit and actually hurt after a few minutes, which means I had to get my own earbuds.  I don't know why companies can't throw in tinier buds with silicon nubs on them.  How much more expensive can they be?  (So I spend $30 on a player and have to spend another $30 on the earbuds?) Minus a star.- the description says \"touchpad\" not \"touchscreen\".  I know that should be clear enough that it's NOT a touchscreen, but I think the word \"keypad\" would be much better.- the music quality - I already had very nice earbuds (with soft silicon!), but the music sounded tinny through them.  I plugged this into speakers, and the music was still very thin and tinny.  Minus 2 stars - this is a music player after all.I have a Motorola Atrix phone and used to have an iPhone 3GS - both phones have much better sound quality.  I was looking forward to using this to work out because I didn't want to bounce my phone around.I really wanted to like this, but the music quality and the hard earbuds knocked too many stars off to justify enthusiastically recommending it to someone.  However, I really like the just drag and drop functionality to get music onto the device.  It's easy to use, just not great.  But it's also only $30."}

{"reviewerID":"A19Q3HK34DR5H7","reviewText":"After doing a ton of research on this TV and searching out almost every source I could to scour any information from, I still wasn't completely sure this was the TV I wanted.  I was looking for a bedroom TV to primarily watch cable, play Xbox, and maybe watch a few movies.  I was on the fence about this TV, and having never even heard of the company wasn't making things any more reassuring.  Eventually, I just leaned on Amazon's TV return policy and jumped in.  Couldn't be happier that I did.Via Amazon Prime, I opted for free 2 day shipping, and true to it, it showed up on the morning of the 2nd day.  Others have had problems with boxes showing up a little battered and bruised, but mine looked as new as the day it left the factory.  Quickly opened it up and set it up to check for dead pixels...not-a-one.  Everything was looking great.Only took a few minutes to detach the base stand from the back of the TV (as it was shipped) and screw all 5 screws to the base.  I had honestly half-expected the TV to be so-so by how many derogatory haters there are out there, but it was as vivid as you could imagine.  Screen was extremely bright, crisp and clear.  Apparently we've got a lot of window-shoppers offering their opinions again.I had originally shown a lot of concern for the whole 120Hz buzz that's going around, but found the 60Hz to be more than acceptable.  In fact, i'm still not seeing any notable blur.  Not on Blu-Ray, not on MW3 or Forza3 for Xbox, not on sports.  It's definitely surpassing my expectations.  I kind of laugh at how I was ready to purchase a $600 LG for twice the price just to feel like i'm not \"rolling the dice\" on a new TV, but i'm glad I didn't.  It supplies all my needs for a bedroom TV, and then some.As for cons, well the most annoying part about the TV would be that frigging energy saver sticker that they put on the shiny, front panel of the TV.  Of course when you try to peel it off, no matter how careful you are, it still leaves GOBS of residue all of the place, then you have to goo-gone it and spend a good 20+minutes cleaning that stuff off.  It's just unreal that they wouldn't at least use a tacky adhesive-free sticker on the front surface of the TV.  However, I couldn't hold this against the TV for a star, as it did come off and doesn't affect the longevity, appearance or the performance of the TV.The speakers are maybe just a hair on the \"tinsy\" side, but they are acceptable for just watching TV and playing games at a reasonable volume.  They aren't as aweful as many made them out to be, but they aren't the greatest you'll find in a TV either.  The TV does come with a digital audio out as well as RCA outs, so using some source of external amplification very quickly solves this problem.  Even a cheap set of 2.1 computer speakers can make the sound drastically better if the speakers bother you enough.The only other minor gripe would be the remote.  Others had mentioned that it was a flimsy little thing, and they were right.  It is very generic and looks like about the quality of a remote that would come with an air conditioner or other appliance.  Worse yet, you really do have to point the remote EXACTLY at the blue power light (IR sensor location is below it) to get it to register anything.  This was surprising at first, but you quickly get used to it, and it's almost forgotten.  Again, it didn't affect the performance of the TV, so I didn't find it worthy of losing any stars.If you're down this far in the review, you know all the stats, so i'm not going to bother listing everything here.  It does everything it's supposed to, and IMO, does it VERY nicely.  For a brand I hadn't even heard of before I stumbled across it, I'm very impressed.  Originally, I was very concerned when I discovered that TCL products in the USA are usually relabeled to RCA; fortunately, it hasn't lived up to the same downfall RCA is known for.  Better yet, with a 2-year warranty (1 year more then most brand-name TVs), I just don't see how you can go wrong.As an honest disclosure, I will say that I'm coming from a 55\" Sony rear-projection LCD that was $3200 in 2005 when I purchased it.  Not exactly a top competitor now-a-days, but even by today's standards, still not a slouch and is 1080i capable.I will also will say...be realistic.  This is NOT a 120Hz, 3D LED-LCD with every bell and whistle you could imagine on it.  It's not the VERY best you can find out there.  However, it also will cost you literally a fraction of what the best out there would.Bang for the buck, you won't find anything more fitting in the 40-42\" range."}

It's supposed to work, but WMC just seems like the way to go if you can. They should also update their mobile apps.  It's not worth using.

{"reviewerID":"A10YIFTLBCRRC5","reviewText":"When I got my TF300 I got an inexpensive Moko case, knowing that it didn't support the keyboard dock, and thinking it likely I would never own said piece of gear. I love my Moko case, it's 90% of what I was looking for, and in my book that's about as good as it gets.Flash forward, I now have the keyboard, and went looking for a Moko case that would accommodate my new attachment, only to be met with disappointment. &#34;No fear!&#34; said I. The Moko was inexpensive, and a great product, so I'll just shop in a comparable price range and strike gold again. I feel like I've died inside a little. My hope is now less than it was. My joy has turned to ashes in my mouth.This case truly does the base function it was designed for, wraps around the tablet and keyboard almost like it was intentional, and then you actually start to use it. It looks -and- feels cheap. It doesn't have a cut out for the head phone jack as mentioned by other reviews. The holes that are cut out for the cameras are aligned badly. The inside holes are too far left. The outside camera hole is too low. This bugged me a bit, but then I realized that it doesn't matter... You can't take a picture while it's in the case anyway - the main flap comes off the top, and so covers the camera when you have it open, unless you've got a third hand to hold the flap while you take your picture. Surprise - major surgery required to operate camera while tablet is in this case, both on the case and yourself.Next gripe. the snaps that hold the keyboard cover to the main cover - they're ugly. The elastic that holds the keyboard onto it's flap of faux pleather blocks the charging port on the one side, and the USB port on the other. But wait, they have a cut out for the SD card slot - which is mis-aligned. Really, by this point I'm thinking that two stars may be generous, so let's look at the positives before I wrap up here.I like:The main flap has magnets to keep it closed. Really, when I was looking for my first non-keyboard case, this was my #1 requirement, and when I ordered this case I wasn't paying attention to whether it had them or not, so kudos for getting this feature right, or did they? Wouldn't it be nice in a case with a removable keyboard flap to be able to close the case once you remove the keyboard? Yes, yes it would, and yet you can't. As soon as you remove the keyboard component to the case, the magnets have nothing to attach to. Unless you've got an extra bungee cord or something to sling around it, you're flapping in the wind.How about I wrap this up?Should you buy this case? Yes! IF any of these situations apply to you.You are loaded with cash, and are tired of throwing it in the wind.You have a tablet and keyboard combination that have ports and cameras in the locations where this case has cutouts.You plan on ripping it apart for the magnets.You are a masochist - nothing wrong with that.You won't actually use your tablet, just set it somewhere and want to keep the dust off - inside a plastic bag.You need a prank gift for someone you dis-like.You should not buy this case if any of the following apply to you:You are human.You have been warned. I honestly have no idea how this case got any positive reviews at all."}

The main buttons are easy to push (only Microsoft does this right also). The forward and back side buttons are a little small but work fine. The scroll wheel is not as nice as the MS Intellimouse 4 as it still clicks and is harder to roll. Never used the tilt wheel on the MS mouse. It is gaming where this mouse shines. The mouse tracks no matter how fast I move the mouse. The mouse never sleeps so it always responds perfectly. Frankly, I have not yet found any use that I needed to change the mouse resolution (i.e. speed) but in trials that is easy to do.Feel is good, middle to small sized so fits most of my family. Cord is thin and a little stiff so it does not always lay completely flat (I have not found on that did). Very lightweight. Contoured nicely to fit the cupped hand.Worked with Win XP as soon as I plugged it in, drivers and program loaded with no hassle.Nice job, Logitech!"}
{"reviewerID":"A17SK2GQ2DSW82","reviewText":"I intended this amp to drive an external set of bookshelf speakers for my flatscreen TV. I do have a complete 7.1 system, but I don't like to fire it up just to watch the news or late evening programs, saving that for CDs\/BDs\/HD and music with guests. I wanted something a bit richer than the monitor built-ins, my minimum criteria was something in the 15-20w range, with auto-on so I could simply turn on the TV from its remote and be set, all in a compact footprint less than the 17\" rack-mount standard. I received the amp (very quick delivery), and decided to test it in my office, driving some favorite RCA\/Optimus Pro7 bookshelves (50Wx2) using an iPod for signal input, a setup which is currently driven from my old Technics SA-626 very nicely. On the AMP50, the output is fine, but the auto-on feature is very flaky, the amp cuts out intermittently and requires a manual re-start. I suspected that the signal strength from the iPod may not be strong enough for the AMP50 to reliably sense, but if that's the case, then almost any line input signal would produce the same intermittent behavior, particularly if using a variable input at low levels such as the iPod or a TV monitor. There is a loud pop on cold startup (using the on\/off switch), I detected a smaller pop on a warm start (from the auto-on standby, when it worked) as reported by other reviewers but not startlingly loud. I ran it for about 20 minutes, it got warm to the touch but not hot; I did not run it for an extended period to test overheating. Inasmuch as one of my main criteria for purchasing the AMP50 was the auto-on feature, its performance is very disappointing. I expect my next attempt will be theAudioengine N22 Premium Desktop Audio Amplifier.For those wanting more of a physical description: The power supply is a brick type, input 120V 75W, output AC 18V 2200mA, about 3\"x3\"x4\", very heavy, with only about 3' of cord on either end (120V wall socket, 18V cylindrical output, not labeled but presumed center pin positive). The unit itself is moderately well built, sheet metal case (screwed, not riveted), lots of ventilation slots, fuse is accessible from the backside, the speaker connectors are common push-snap type for bare wire ends, the RCA\/pin jack inputs are chrome plated. Exterior finish was fine, no burrs or blemishes, flat black paint. The front panel is brushed and painted aluminum, nice but not remarkable. Knobs also appear to be machined and painted aluminum. Its weight is about what you might expect; not light but not heavy. It accepts RCA\/pin jacks or 1\/8\" stereo jack for input. The front power switch is a large pushbutton-toggle type about 5\/8\" diameter; if you intend to use this without the auto-on feature (turning it on an off when desired), you will find that the action to press the on\/off button will want to push the amp back on its shelf, it is not heavy enough to resist the on\/off button press action and the enclosure feet are hard plastic; they slide and do not resist the push. The auto-on\/manual select switch is a slide switch on the back panel. When power is off, either manual or auto, the front-panel red LED power indicator goes off (at least it did so on mine), so there is no indication that it is in standby mode. There seemed sufficient power to drive the speakers (50Wx2); with the iPod at full signal output the speakers were comfortable at a volume setting of about half the AMP50 range; that's for light listening in my office where I could hold a conversation without turning down the volume. I expect the AMP50 could drive the speakers loudly enough for a backyard party, but not enough to break any glasses.I give it two stars because as an amp, the AMP50 is certainly adequate and up to the task, but a principal feature for which I purchased it (auto-on) is to me unsatisfactory."}

The sound fields are very well set up and all are useful depending on what you are listening to. My other (more expensive) receiver is a Pioneer and the majority of its sound fields are downright crude and irritating except for the \"auto\" setting. The Sony setup menu could be a little more user friendly. The auto speaker setup with the microphone seems to work well. Speaker outputs aren't quite as configurable as I'd like but that's not a big deal since my speakers are well matched to begin with.  The FM sensitivity is merely adequate, as are most tuners these days, but who listens to FM radio at home anymore?Overall this is a great receiver for the money - everything I need without all the bells and whistles I rarely would have used anyway.

You can remove your device from the dock and keep listening, and you can control things using the dock buttons.As some others have pointed out, your device won't fit in this when in its case, though that may not apply to devices with a very thin case (like on my Amaze 4G). Some (mostly tablet devices) can't charge over MicroUSB, but they'll still stream music.All in all, the only downside is the price - there are some other Bluetooth speaker dock options out there, but none designed specifically for Android devices.

{"reviewerID":"ALFYZ5EEXV5GH","reviewText":"I was looking for an affordable N router which would supplement the Actiontec router which Verizon provided for free with my FiOS plan. Supposedly due to the large number of wireless devices at home, the Actiontec router was crashing or not performing well in general. Devices would lose Wi-Fi connectivity, and we got tired of rebooting the Actiontec to resolve the issue. Perhaps a more advanced user could figure out how to resolve the problem, but I decided to connect this Asus router to the Actiontec instead.The Asus router is working smoothly in AP mode. Now I have two Wi-Fi networks at home. I keep certain devices connected to the Asus so they can see each other (e.g. Apple TV, Mac, iPhone). The old Actiontec router handles the other devices. Since the last 2-3 weeks, the Actiontec router has not crashed, whereas previously it was crashing every other day or so.I experimented with the Asus in router mode, but I was unable to get connectivity to the internet. I was not sure whether the Actiontec needed to be reconfigured to make this work. However, using the Asus in AP mode, I did not have to change any settings in the Actiontec. The only constraint with that solution is getting one SSID instead of multiple SSIDs out of the Asus. While I may have overlooked a detail in the setup, with 20 minutes of trying, I could not figure out a way to get multiple SSIDs in AP mode.The built-in menus of the Asus (accessed via browser at 192.168.1.x) are not as advanced as the Actiontec. The software provided on the Asus CD may be required to access advanced features. Fortunately, I never needed to install the CD to achieve the basic functionality which was required.I was looking for a solution to Actiontec crashes, and the Asus appears to have done the trick with great ease."}

{"reviewerID":"A33SG2UA24DJ9P","reviewText":"You read a lot of reviews about universal remotes, good and bad, but often the writer doesn't say what equipement they are controlling.  For reference, I'm controlling a Explorer 8300 DVR, a Panasonic receiver, a Sony TV, and a PS2 I use for both games and as a DVD player.  For this this setup, this remote works really well.  If you have a more elaborate setup, perhaps that changes things.I think most of the positives of this remote (the elegant button layout, the very good and easy setup, the intuitive \"help\" when things don't power up as expected, etc.) have been well covered.  But my few complaints on the remote are:- As others have stated, having the setup software on the web, running through a browser, seems needless and can be problematic.  In Windows, because of SP2 browser security, etc., you're always fighting with alerts and right-clicking to allow files to download and open--it would really be a LOT better if they had an app you ran directly from your machine.  I have no idea why Logitech chooses to set this remote up through a browser, but no matter how well they have implmeneted this it would be MUCH faster and MUCH more reliable to have the setup application on your machine.  It's almost a \"square peg in a round hole\" situation.  Get this stuff in a desktop app.- Buttons.  Why do so many universal remotes (including this one) not have a dedicated \"List\" button?  This is the most prominent key on all the DVR remotes I've seen, yet you have to set this up through the LCD screen.  It's strange.  Also omitted is a \"C\" button, which again, is used on almost ever DVR that I've seen.  Not sure why these are ommitted and buttons like \"Media\" have had room cleared for them.  \"Page Up\" and \"Page Down\" would also be nice additions.  I set these up on both the LCD and instead of the \"Repeat\" and additional \"Forward\" button are, but these are important features that would be better on the remote itself.- Media button.  I found this whole feature useless.  Having any guide or show information coming through a remote, favorite channels, etc.--I just don't use this at all.  Would rather they dump this entirely and make way for buttons that to me seem necessary (like List, Page Up\/Page Down, \"C\", etc.)-The \"Pic\" and \"Sound\" buttons are also somewhat limited because you can only specify that they point at one device each.  The \"sound\" menu, for instance, has to point at a receiver, and the \"pic\" has to point to a TV.  This is difficult to explain, but the \"Pic\" menu, for instance, typically offers things like \"PIP\" functions.  My TV does not have a PIP feature, but my DVR does.  But because I can't have any DVR device functions in the \"Pic\" menu (it points to the TV only), these features are not as useful as they could be.  So Pic and Sound would be more helpful if offered greater customization.- Key Repeats.  Don't push on a volume or channel button too many times.  If you do, the device will keep advancing\/decreasing long after you stop pressing.  The remote seems to \"queue\" up your clicks if you go to fast--that's taken me some adjusting to.On the positive side, what's surprising to me about it is how much better it is than the remote I eventually got frustrated with (but is slightly more expensive)--a Home Theater Master MX-500.  The Harmony remote has a much better key layout and has a much broader range than the MX--you can point the remote almost anywhere and it seems to pick up the signal.  With the MX I had to point the remote \"just so\" to get things to happen.Overall for me I found this to be a great purchase--but, like me, you'll probably find there's still a little room for improvement."}

If you have gotten to this bundle you have already decided on the RX100 and are just trying to get some additional value as I was. I will not speak to the quality of the Camera as that has been done much better than I could do.I managed to get the Camera today with the associated goodies.What you get for your $11 premium over the camera alone are:Spare battery -- not Sony brand it says it is 1600mah vs 1240mah for the stock Sony time will tell if that is accurateTripod --------- Zeikos brand its tiny-- pocket size-- it even has a clip for your pocket. Not complaints for what it is.Cleaning kit --- A small bottle of fluid, 5 q-tips, and a small microfiber snippit.Camera case ---- Vivitar brand Meh it will do nothing fancy better than letting it get banged against car keys in a purse.Card reader ---- Zeikos brand it will do the job and I suppose if you don't want to plug the camera into the computer its ok.LCD protector -- Zeikos brand a universal product you have to cut to fit, the cardboard squeege with it scratches it up:(32GB SDHC ------ Sony Brand item #SF-32NX this is what you are paying for. $23.20 with prime is the cheapest on Amazon.Sony SF32NX\/TQ 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory CardSo in summary in my opinion the only thing really worth the price in order of value are the Sony 32gb card-- that alone is a steal. The tripod is nice I can see it being useful and who doesn't like a spare battery even if it is cheap and craps out quickly it is basically free. The rest are junk and if I would have known the lcd screen protectors would scratch so easily I would have ordered a good one already cut to fit with the camera."}

{"reviewerID":"A2LCE1D0TW2XY0","reviewText":"I bought this case for a Core i7 build after perusing about fifty others at Fry's and Microcenter. As of early 2010, it was one of the few with clean aesthetics and a noise-concealing design for under $100. My point of reference is Antec's Solo, a heavier and more expensive case that eclipsed the original Sonata as Antec's preferred enclosure for silent-PC enthusiasts.IMPRESSIONS:First impressions are typical Antec. The Proto is steel and slightly heavier than most cases in the size range, though the build feels only about 7\/10 of the Solo. There four removable drive caddies perpendicular to the long axis of the case. Silicon vibration-reducing grommets are preinstalled on the caddies, with the same silicon on the case feet. PCI slot covers are steel with screws. The rear fan is a two-speed 120mm, similar to the three-speed on the Solo in volume in cooling capacity. That's to say, lots of cooling at a particular voltage and not quite silence even at the lowest setting. Also like the Solo, the power supply is mounted high in the traditional location instead of the modern trend to put it on the case floor.A few negatives: There isn't any noise dampening material on the one removable panel. While this was mostly an affectation on the Solo, it's still missed. Both cases have a rear fan powered by a molex connector and a physical speed switch. Antec should have moved to 3-pin or 4-pin PWM control long ago. The Proto also has a long fan filter that slides upward from the bottom of the case near the front panel and snaps into place. The plastic tabs that hold it in snap off easily. This is the only obvious area of poor build quality.Other cases in the price range have plastic quick-access PCI slot covers instead of steel and flimsy plastic drive caddies. They also tend to have more ventilation than the Proto, which has no holes on the top, bottom, or either case panel. Airflow is dictated by two fans: the first behind the drive trays (the Solo has two in front of its trays), and the second, the rear fan. Also unlike the Solo, there's a fiddly handle on the side of the main case panel, and the two thumbscrews holding the panel in aren't permanently attached.FINISH:Matte-black on all the major panels, unfinished or gray-painted steel on the rear, and black plastic with a subtle sheen on the front. The front of the case really is quite attractive in dimmer lighting. I've uploaded a picture. The Solo has a boxier look, though some might prefer the gloss-black paint on that one.INSTALLATION:There's only one removable case panel and no separate motherboard tray. You can't get to the back of the motherboard, so you can't route cables there like you could with the Solo. If you use an aftermarket heatsink with a backplate, you'll have to disassemble the entire system to remove it. Replacing the power supply would require the same.The perpendicular orientation of the drive bays leaves more room for motherboard installation and video cards 11\" or under. You can also more easily hide your cables behind the drive caddies, but this comes at a price. Drive installations are very awkward because the back of drives face the fixed case panel. Short of putting a mirror in the case, you can't see what you're doing to connect the cables. Flipping a drive so the rear faces the open panel causes clearance issues. Connecting the cables with the drives partially removed from the case requires too much cable slack for a clean install.Silence isn't quite assured from the outset. The silicon tray grommets are just as ineffective as they were in Solo for quelling hard disk vibration. With two drives installed conventionally, the Proto has a noticeable hum. However, though there isn't an integral drive suspension system like the Solo, there are plenty of holes to craft your own with Stretch Magic. It takes only two 10\" pieces per drive, looped and held together with a square knot. Connecting the SATA and power cables is even more awkward, but the system becomes inaudible when you finish.That's about it for this case. It has solid build quality, it's quiet, attractive, and not overly expensive. Cooling is only average though, and it clearly wasn't designed to have parts changed out.SILENCE AND HOW TO GET IT:Since a few of you interested in this case might want it for a silent system, here's the skinny: component choice is key. The Proto is an incremental improvement over other cases. That increment won't silence parts that sound like a hamster on a merry-go-round. If you're not starting from scratch and you're unwilling to modify or replace what you've got, earplugs are more efficient and effective than any enclosure.Power use creates heat. Heat needs to be moved out of the case with fans, which cause noise. Some fans are better than others. Beyond that, mechanical things can have an inherent whine and vibrate in such a way to make the case panels hum.The major components:CPU: Choose something from a recent product line, but not on the bleeding edge of frequency. Intel chips fare best if you choose an architecture with on-chip video. AMD's chips are also capable of very low idle power consumption, though ultimate performance isn't quite as high.Video card: If you're assembling from scratch and don't play 3D games, choose a motherboard with integrated video. AMD and Intel have motherboards with integrated video for almost all processors. Check to verify your chip supports it. Or you could buy a passively-cooled graphics card. The tiny fans on video cards tend to wear out after a year or two and cause nasty noise. Anything over $30 is plenty for Windows. For gaming cards, you'll have to live with some noise during games unless you've got an expensive aftermarket cooler, but almost all recent cards will slow their fans at idle.Motherboard: If it supports your chip and doesn't have a fan, it's fine. Be aware that certain high-zoot chipsets like Intel's X-line draw upwards of 40W at idle.CPU Heatsink: A big, heavy tower with a slow 120mm fan on the side. The stock Intel cooler isn't bad, but it isn't silent either. Effective 120mm fans include the Nexus Real Silent Case Fan and Antec's own TriCool. Scythe makes excellent tower heatsinks.CPU and case fans: Big and slow. Standard case fans are 80mm. They have to be wound up to move air. 120mm (or larger) fans can run effectively at 600 RPM where they're well below ambient noise. The lowest setting of the Antec fan of the Proto is in this range.Power supply: 80-plus certified with a 120mm or 140mm fan and sized for the system. The average power draw for most systems at idle is 50W-100W. Under load, they'll pull 125W-175W. A gaming graphics card will add 75W-175W to the load total. You want at least 25% more capacity than your maximum potential load. The major quiet brands are Corsair and Seasonic. Corsair costs less. Budget at least $50 here before rebates. Crap power supplies, even if they don't destroy your system, may buzz, whine, or come with a fan that'll wear out in six months.Hard disk: For mechanical disks, choose a lower-middle capacity on a recently-introduced product line. Fewer platters make less vibration and use less power. The largest drive in any particular product line will have 4 or 5 platters. Divide by either number for a drive likely to have one platter. Because recent drives tend not to whine like older ones, decoupling the drive from the chassis with rubber line will effectively silence the system. Or you could spring for an SSD, which doesn't vibrate and uses under 3W.Case: The more holes it has and the flimsier the construction, the more noise it will make. It doesn't matter if it's steel or aluminum; if the case panels aren't well-damped, any vibration from the case components (hard disks and every fan) will be magnified. Among mid-tower ATX cases, Antec's Solo and Solo II are among the quietest available at any price. The Proto and Sonata series aren't too far back if you suspend the hard disks. Likewise for Cooler Master's Sileo series. Fractal Design's R-series is also worth a look. Cases on both sides of the cost spectrum tend to put more emphasis on ventilation. Because a clean airflow path is often at odds with silence, component choice is still key.Case fans: Not every fan has the same cooling capacity at a particular noise or vibration level. Rotational speed at a given voltage varies, and some fans become unusually loud at some speeds. Other fans respond poorly to undervolting by refusing to spin, ticking, or buzzing. Fans with sleeve bushings instead of ball bearings suffer most. Don't expect your case to come with decent kit; even this Proto's dual-speed fans are merely average. Nexus Real Silent Case Fans perform admirably for systems with modest airflow requirements. To set the right input voltage, you can use a hardware or software fan controller, or a basic 12V\/5V switch.If you find this review unhelpful, please leave a comment. I do try to be accurate, I'd much prefer to know the issue."}

{"reviewerID":"AVCLMVDU3FMSH","reviewText":"I've been using my Audigy for about a month.  First, ignore the comments that it doesn't work with XP.  Mine works fine with XP using the drivers download from the Creative web page.  I bought it because I have a stack of old vinyl albums collected in the 60's and 70's that I want to put on audio CDs (since they are not available commercially as such).  The Audigy Platinum makes that job much easier by putting the audio Line In connectors on the front of my PC.  Standard stereo cables work fine without the need for an assortment of adapters or trying to decipher the tiny hieroglyphics on the sound card bracket.  We also used it for some direct-to-disk recording with a microphone last week and it worked fine for that as well.  The audio editing software that came with the Audigy was much easier than trying to do the same with a cassette deck.  Again, having a real microphone jack and level control on the front of the PC made it simple to use.  I used it to create a couple of MP3 disks and they play fine on my portable CD MP3 player.It was a bit of a pain to install the internal cables and the drawings in the manual didn't exactly match my unit.  Even so, I managed to get everything installed and working in less than an hour.  I haven't bought a set of 5.1 speakers yet but probably will since I sometimes watch DVDs using my PC.  The sound from the card using my existing stereo speakers is fine regardless of the source of the sound."}

(Hopefully this will change in the near future.)2 - The USB connection is really allow you to connect in a pinch, when you have no access to a router.  It is not intended to connect and be formatted as a regular USB drive.  If you need a local USB drive, get one, its cheaper than this one.3 - Speed.  The only way to get a faster than this, is to dedicate a computer to serving files,  Install Mac OS X Server, that would be faster than the embedded server in this device, but at how much more power & cost?I actually ran a speed comparison with my Mac Mini that is currently running Leopard -- file transfer were nearly the same, albeit the Mac Mini has a laptop drive in it, but it has a full scale G4 processor in it, far more power than the embedded processor in the LaCie driveThe Good Stuff:1 - This is one of the few NAS drives that supports AFP directly.  This is the feature I was waiting for, in order to go NAS. All of the Apple metadata gets stored without loss,  Very Very good!  I hate having to use an SMB connection to a FAT32 filesystem.  That is not Mac, and will never replace AFP.2. When I installed the drive,  I plugged it into my router,  opened Safari and opened its web page from the Bonjour list.  After setting up all my users and shared, I then popped the CD into my computer to read the manual.3. This drive does not require additional software on your computer, if your computer can connect to a router, it will talk to this drive.4. The drive can be expanded, you can plug an additional USB drive into it,  that drive then becomes shared also.The Bad Stuff:1. The web administration interface is slow, but since I don't plan on administering the drive every day, I don't think its a real drawback.2. The drive never seems to spin down.  Some people like this because its instantly available at a moment's notice, I personally would prefer it to to have a user adjustable sleep timer, to save energy and have less wear on the drive mechanism.Overall:Like the LaCie drives I've used in the past, Its in a metal case, it feels solid, and it works well, and its made in the USA!Also LaCie supports the Mac,  as a forethought, not an afterthought."}

None of the others have this much bass extension and impact, detailed highs that sparkle (a little bit sibilant though), and an overall neutral sound signature.  For that reason, and because they are lighter and more comfortable than the HE-400, the DT880 are my most-used headphones.Compared to the Sennheiser HD600, the DT880:-Have better sub-bass extension-Are more detailed-Have cord on only one side (more convenient but less reliable over time)-Have fixed cord (cannot be replaced)-Are more transparent, wider soundstage (some disagree, but to me these sound less \"in my head\")-Are less natural sounding-Are more sibilant and fatiguing (cymbals sometimes sound harsh)A few words for those trying to pick between the DT-880 models:-The Pro and Premium 250 Ohm use the same drivers and therefore sound exactly the same except that the clamp strength is slightly tighter for the Pro than the Premium, which changes the sound a tiny bit (more bass).  If you stretch the headband a bit on the Pro, it sounds exactly like the Premium-The 32 ohm model is meant to be driven by phones, iPods, etc, does not need a dedicated amp, but many who have compared it to the others say that it does not sound as good as the 250 and 600 ohm models-Most who have done side by side comparisons of the 250 and 600 ohm models find that they sound the same, yet the 600 ohm model has a reputation for being the best sounding, likely because the people using it are pairing it with higher end amps, or possibly just because of \"placebo effect\".  I would and did get the 250 ohm model because it is easier to drive (I can use them without a dedicated amp if I need to, though they sound much better if I do.-The Pro model comes with a coiled cord, while the Premiums have a straight cord.  They also have obvious style differences.  I preferred the coiled cord and looks of the Pro model.The current sub-$200 price of the DT-880 Pro 250 ohm model on Amazon is a steal.

The sound was excellent for such a small radio, likely owing to the innovative design of the tall case with the speaker at the bottom, giving some backside depth to the speaker installation. I would love to see this same design with HD FM & AM reception, & maybe a jack for an external AM loop. I would highly recommend this radio."}

{"reviewerID":"A2ER4HW1J249PL","reviewText":"Not a lot of detail one can add to a review of a replacement part, but it works perfectly and I think it is quieter than the original color wheel when the tv was new.  Maybe that's just my imagination, but it certainly is quiet.  I was skeptical I could fix my 9 year old Samsung DLP TV myself for 90 bucks, but after watching a couple youtube videos I gave it a shot.  It took me about 3 hours to tear my tv apart, install the colorwheel and put it all back together, but that was mainly due to my trying to document where every screw and wire that I disconnected came from while I was taking things apart.  In any event, TV is as good as new after installing this part.  No more screaming color wheel.It has been a couple months since I installed it.  I will update the review if the part doesn't last."}

{"reviewerID":"A1M4QC5BZDMBIZ","reviewText":"So, we ski often (about ten times every winter) - and I have long since looked for the perfect set of headphones to use while skiing.  Here are the problems:- It is as active sport, so you don't want them to fall out of your ear while moving around- You want them to be compact and small so they fit comfortably under your helmet flaps- You want external sounds to pass through while you are listening so you can hear warnings and other skiers (i.e. the exact opposite of noise canceling!)- You want to control the volume without having to dig the MP3 player out of your many layers (this is a constant annoyance as most people like to chat on the lift)This headset answers the mail perfectly.  I used to use a pair of Sony over the ear clip on style headphones, and they worked well for staying on and passing through sound, but they become increasingly uncomfortable as the day wore on.Pros:- Great, comfortable fit (even for 8 hours!)- Good sound quality- They don't block out external sounds- Volume control is on the cord - PERFECT!  Now I can turn it up and down without digging in my pockets to get it- You can skip, pause, and rewind with a small \"clicker\" on the left ear cord - very convenientCons:- They won't block out external sounds (this is only a con if you are looking for noise cancelling headphones!)- You can't work the volume control with gloves on (it is tiny)"}

{"reviewerID":"AYO3MP1PYKC1W","reviewText":"I wanted this USB drive and got it for xmas this past year, I love it for the most part. It holds your passwords, and can encrypt data for you. those functions work but are a little clunky, but they work. the best part is that the drive will not appear until you swipe your finger, so all your data on the drive is off limits until that point. And that aspect works well. The most annoying part is that I have never ever been able to get the thing to work with one finger swipe, it normally takes four or five swipes, and I have had to try as many as 20 swipes before it would work, which is just ridiculous. I have even tried different fingers and redoing it all together. The funny thing is that the picture it shows you of your finger swipe looks amazingly detailed, much more detail that other Biometric scanners I have and use. My laptop (A Motion Computing LE1600) has one and I rarely ever have to swipe it more than once to get into it.I would recommend this drive, just know this annoying trait and you'll be fine. Maybe they will update the software one day and it will fix this problem ( I will keep checking ).EDIT: 2\/18\/2010 I dont know if this thing gets better with age, or maybe I get better at using it but lately it has worked when scanning my figer on the first or second try. thought I needed to update this review since the only issue I had with this unit is becoming a none issue."}

{"reviewerID":"A2HAP9A9OMBDU4","reviewText":"The lenses I've owned in similar ranges are the Nikon 18-70mm f\/3.5-4.5 and the Tamron 17-50mm f\/2.8.  Comparing this lens to the 18-70mm is probably a bit unfair, so I won't mention it again.  However, there are many people looking for alternatives and the Tamron 17-50mm is as close as it gets so I'll base this review as a comparison to the Tamron.  Having owned the Tamron for a few weeks before offing it, I can tell you this.  If you're looking for a lens that equally matches or even exceeds the 17-55mm in terms of image quality, then by all means, go for the Tamron.  Equality pretty much ends there.The advantages of the Nikon 17-55mm are the following:BUILD QUALITY - You immediately notice the build quality as soon as you handle and inspect the 17-55mm.  It's encased in metal and nicely sealed so dust, moisture (which leads to fungus) will hopefully be minimized.  \"Built like a tank\" is a good cliche.FAST FOCUS - The Silent Wave Motor is not only fast, but extremely quiet.SHARP WIDE OPEN - Using an aperture of f\/2.8, this lens is very usable.  Another advantage is that is focuses more accurately in low light.  This is an aspect that was inferior in the Tamron.COLOR RENDITION - I've found colors out of the lens are very satisfying with little need to \"tweak\" during post processing.  The Tamron had a warmer color, but this may vary among copies.MINIMAL CA - CA didn't bother me much in the Tamron, but it's much more controlled on the 17-55mm, especially wide open.BETTER QUALITY CONTROL - This was the deal breaker with the Tamron.  I received a copy that overexposed which is in line with the experiences of many people with that particular lens.  Although sample variance exists with Nikon, it's much more controlled.SIZE\/WEIGHT\/BALANCE - Some people mention this lens is too bulky and heavy.  I find the size and weight actually helpful and helps balance and control on the majority of camera bodies.The 17-55mm doesn't have any major flaws for me.  I'm not a professional nor am I a pixel peeper.  I'm just an enthusiast that likes good image quality.  However, if I were to knit pick, here are the flaws:SMALL ZOOM RING - It's annoyingly small at first, but you get used to it.FLARES EASILY - Point it at a light source directly or even indirectly and this lens has a propensity to flare.  You can certainly use the massive hood to mitigate flare.DISTORTION AT WIDE END - Some say the distortion at the wide end makes this lens unusable for landscape\/architecture work.  If you're looking for a lens specifically for that task, you may want to consider a true wide angle lens like the 12-24mm or 14-24mm or go Sigma 10-20mm.  However, I find this lens quite usable at the wide end.One peculiarity with the 17-55mm is that it's at its shortest length almost fully zoomed at around 45mm and longest and fully extended at 17mm.  I found this amusing since I haven't experienced other lenses with this characteristic.In my research, I also considered the new Nikon 24-70mm f\/2.8.  This lens should definitely be on your list because it offers the latest technology and it's a full frame (FX) lens.  I ruled it out because it's not only $500 more than the 17-55mm, but also because it's not wide enough for my purposes.  Also, I happen to be under the opinion that DX has at least a few more years before it becomes obsoleted\/deprecated by FX.  People are beginning to recommend against investing in DX lenses, but IMHO, affordable full frame bodies are years away.Ultimately, I selected the Nikkor 17-55mm over the Tamron 17-50mm because of its superior usability wide open.  The hit on my pocketbook was rather significant, but I have no regrets of getting such a excellent lens with a great usable range.  If Nikon ever added VR to this lens, then it would be a dream come true.  I state this because I often need to use a shutter speed of 1\/30 or slower when shooting in low light and I rarely use a tripod.  VR would come in extremely handy in this situation to prevent camera shake.I highly recommend this lens.  It's on my camera 9 times out of 10.  Okay, I'll stop now."}

Some cards come loaded with native RAID firmware and have to be 'downgraded' to use the available ports as regular SATA 3 ports. Not so the Mediasonic ProBox HP1-SS3 add-on card. It is advisable to load the Mediasonic Windows drivers for Windows, but most modern BIOS's recognize the add-on card and any hard drives connected to it, so it's simply a matter of installing Windows drivers after Windows is installed.Fact is, if your BIOS recognizes the Mediasonic add-on card and the drive(s) connected to it, you can boot from those drives without any problem.

I cannot count the splits I've missed with previous watches because I didn't hear the beep.I'm not crazy about the wireless only connection to my PC or the proprietary charging connector but, for me, the pros outweigh the cons and since this is a non-current model, it can be found at a discount."}

{"reviewerID":"ACHTDPEQYSEQL","reviewText":"The runtastic GPS watch is a good entry level watch with a heart rate monitor that is less expensive than the Garmin GPS watches.  I also own theGarmin Forerunner 405 Wireless GPS-Enabled Sport Watch with USB ANT Stick and Heart Rate Monitor (Black)which I have been using for several years and so I have compared the Garmin watch versus the runtastic watch as part of this review.  The runtastic watch has a lot of nice features.  However, I found it to be less accurate than my Garmin watch.  Neither watch was perfect, but the runtastic watch was half as accurate as the Garmin watch and that will matter to someone who really wants to keep close track of their distances.  I also really didnt like the online experience with the news feed of workouts of people I dont know and the default privacy settings of sharing all of my information.  Overall I found the runtastic watch to be good, but not great in comparison to the Garmin watch.Whats in the box?When your runtastic watch arrives in its box, you will find the GPS watch, a heart rate monitor, a USB cable for downloading data and for charging the watch and a bike support for mounting the watch to your handlebars.  The handlebar mount is a nice touch but I was disappointed that only a USB cable was included and not an adapter so that the watch could be plugged into a wall outlet to charge.StyleThe runtastic watch has a square face with a reflective rim around the face.  The rest of the watch is black.  The watch could be worn as an everyday watch, especially so since it offers other features such as dual time zones, alarm and timer.  However, the reflective silver rim around the watch face gives it a bit of a cheap look and I would have preferred if runtastic had left the whole watch black.  In terms of size, the runtastic watch is slightly bigger than the Garmin 405Cx, but it is also noticeably heavier than the Garmin watch.ControlsThe runtastic watch has five buttons on the sides that allow you to move between menus, to turn on the light and to start and stop the activity tracing.  To access certain menus, you need to hold down the mode button for several seconds.  The buttons on the right are used for toggling between options and the blue, view button is used to select.  While the numerous buttons are levels are functional, I prefer the simplicity of the Garmin controls which use a touch sensitive band around the watch face.DisplayThe display that you see on the watch while you are recording a workout has three data fields that are customizable.  The downloadable manual for the watch states that you can find more information about customizing the fields in section (###).  The (###) is actually how the manual reads.  It is ridiculous in my mind that no one at runtastic has bothered to actually insert the correct section number.  When I did try to customize the fields using the watch menus, I found several German words such as laufen, radfahrer, wandern.  It is again ridiculous that this was not corrected by runtastic to show the words running, cycling and hiking in English.  However, what I did really like is that you can customize the display through the runtastic Connect program you install on your computer to communicate with the watch.  I have included a screen shot of this feature.ChargingBoth watches are charged by attaching a clip to the watches.  The clip goes over the face of the watch and the runtastic version has a rubber mount so that you dont damage the watch face.  However, the Garmin 405Cx includes a adapter so that you can charge from a wall outlet.  The runtastic does not have an adapter and so is designed to plug into the USB port of a computer for charging.  I prefer to be able to plug the watch into the wall outlet so that I can just plug it in when needed without first needing to boot up my computer.  Both watches have battery meters with the runtastic showing the number of hours of use remaining while the Garmin shows the % battery remaining.Satellite ReceptionStanding in my back yard on both sunny and cloudy days with the watches and a stopwatch, I found that the Garmin watch locked onto the satellites faster than the runtastic watch, but only by twenty seconds or so.  While the Garmin watch allows you to see the number of satellites which have been found so that you can see the progress, the runtastic watch shows only that it is locked or that it is not locked to satellites.AccuracyTo compare the accuracy of the runtastic and the Garmin watches, I wore them both and held aGarmin GPSMAP 60Cx Handheld GPS Navigatorin my hand for several days while running.  The Garmin 60Cx is a larger, dedicated GPS device and due to its big antennae, I consider it to be the more accurate than either of the wristwatch GPS's.  Over the course of several runs in areas without a lot of tree cover or high buildings, I found that both the runtastic watch and the Garmin 405Cx recorded less distance than the big, Garmin 60Cx.  On average, the runtastic watch was inaccurate by 0.04 miles per mile travelled and the Garmin 405Cx was inaccurate by 0.02 miles per mile travelled.  This means that if you run 10 miles, the runtatic watch will only record 9.8 miles run.  While neither watch was perfect, the runtastic watch was twice as inaccurate as the Garmin 405Cx.Heart Rate MonitorBoth heart rate monitors include a band of plastic that goes across your chest and is connected to a elastic, nylon band that is attached to the plastic band by two clasps.  The Garmin heart rate monitor (HRM) is thinner than the runtastic version.  The material that makes up the clasps of the Garmin HRM are rigid plastic which means that they are not pliable.  You just insert one end into an opening and snap it into place.  On the other hand, the runtastic HRM clasps are soft plastic.  Once one end is inserted into an opening, you need to press here and there to make sure that the clasp is fully engaged and nothing is sticking up.  I prefer the design of the Garmin heart rate monitor.Water resistanceThe Garmin 405CX is submersible down to 1m.  That means that I dont have to worry about getting it wet when I am training in the rain.  The runtastic watch is rain and splash resistant, but the manual advises that the watch be dried thoroughly before touching any button as water can enter the base through the buttons.  This could be a problem if you wear the watch in the rain and you want to push the stop button at the end of your workout.FeedbackWhat I think that the runtastic watch does better than the Garmin watch is feedback.  The runtastic watch shows you through runtastic Connect how much memory is occupied with saved workouts.  The battery meter shows the level not in percent, but in number of projected hours remaining.  This type of feedback makes it easier to judge when you will need to charge your watch so that you can plan ahead to do it the night before a long run or bike ride.Data TransferTo transfer data, you must attach the included USB clip to the runtastic watch and plug the other end into a USB port.  Data transfer from the Garmin 405Cx is done wirelessly.  You plug the included ANT Stick into a USB port and it transfers the data to Garmin.com automatically once the Garmin watch is detected.  The wireless transfer may reduce the battery life of the Garmin watch, but it is slicker to use.OnlineYou need to create an account through the runtastic website.  You are given the option of upgrading to a gold account which offers more features such as an ad free experience online in exchange for a yearly fee.  What I really did not like is that when you login, there is a feed on the right showing images of people and what they are doing with blurbs urging you to cheer them on.  I have included a screen shot of the website.  Think facebook feed and you have the idea.  The Garmin site has none of this and is focused on you and your workouts rather than what lots of people you dont know are doing.  I also didnt like that by default you are sharing all of your information with everyone.  That is probably why there are so much activity in the feed since by default everyone is sharing.  All of this is a shame because I think that otherwise, the runtastic online information is better than that shown on the Garmin site.  What I especially liked is that you can hover your mouse over one chart and your location on the map at that moment in time in your workout is noted as well.AnnoyancesDuring one of my first runs with the watch, it must have been pressing against my Garmin watch on the same wrist and the watch began beeping.  Every five seconds.  For the whole long run.  I tried to figure out how to stop the beeping but I didnt go too far since I was evaluating the accuracy and didnt want to affect that by pressing the wrong button.  So once home, I went through the settings and even downloaded the manual and thought I had it sorted.  But, the next run it was beeping again.  Fortunately, you can reset the watch to factory settings, but that meant that I had to reconfigure the watch settings.AccessoriesThe Garmin 405CX allows you to purchase accessories to improve your experience such as theGarmin Foot Pod [Retail Packaging] to track your cadence or to track your workouts if you use a treadmill.  The Runtastic watch does not have such an option.SummaryOverall, the runtastic is a good GPS watch.  It has a lot of features including the heart rate monitor at a lower cost than the Garmin watches.  However, you do get what you pay for.  The runtastic is a good entry level watch with some problems such as the accuracy.  That it is not waterproof is one problem if you run in the rain and the online experience is another problem in my mind.  So if you want more out of your GPS watch than the basics, I would recommend looking at the Garmin watches instead.Pros* With all of the features such as a stopwatch and an alarm, the watch could serve as a watch, not just as a GPS watch.* Good feedback such as the number of hours left on the battery and the % of the memory used for storing past workout data.* Cost* The included bicycle mountCons* No plug for a wall outlet, only USB* The runtastic web site is invasive with the default privacy settings and the live feed of random people is annoying.* Accuracy is half that of the Garmin watch* Not waterproof and the manual advises against using the buttons if wet which means that you cant start or stop the activity tracker if you are out in the rain.*  The poor product manual* The mix of German and English in the watch menus"}

{"reviewerID":"A38T94RSGFJHWZ","reviewText":"The product worked as advertised.  I ran into some glitches connecting the device to a SBC\/ATT DSL modem.  Neither company advises you that you must disable the DSL modems internal PPPoE login, and set the login name\/password in the router.  To do this, you have to disconnect the router, log into the modem, change its setting, and then reconnect it to the router.  Once set up, however, it works perfectly.  Wireless access is simple, the signal strength throughout the house it good.  Some applications will need special attention, especially peer to peer server software.  Due to this, I set my network up using static IPs for the desktops plugged into the router, and left 3 open dynamic IPs for logins using the wireless.  Security is easy to set up as well.  For fulltime laptop access, I would recommend the G version, however, for occasional laptop use, and for friends dropping by wanting to connect, the price was well worth it, as 11mps is more than fast enough for all purposes except perhaps streaming dvd video across the network."}
{"reviewerID":"AEXA9RMLEC87C","reviewText":"For the price I have to say it works well, its painted and matches the white ceiling.  It has a minimal footprint so it doesn't look like some huge post hanging from the wall.  There were only a few minor cons I ran into with this product. I could not fit a power cable with a thick jacket through the post unfortunately because it interfered with the locking bolts that run through the middle of the post.  The other flat vga, hdmi, and cat6 were no problem, but I just ran them all together and zip tied them to the outside of the post on the opposing side of traffic to keep them somewhat hidden.  The keystone was off when I tried to initially mount it without the post at the ceiling height I had it at, so I put the post in which put the keystone off in the opposite direction very slightly, so I missed the sweet spot between the minimum length of the post and straight mounting it.  Someone else supposedly cut the post down which could be an option for me as well, but its close enough since I just project onto a wall in a living space, this is not a full time theater room for me.I pre-drilled the holes to the ceiling beam and used a battery powered craftsman right angle impact to snug the bolts in the last bit.  Someone else said the bolts were crap after they broke the heads off.  Wow they must have over torque'd the &@#^% out of those bolts without creating a pilot hole.  I have an older Legacy Sony 720p Sony VPL-VW10HT with 3 mounting holes.  The universal bracket did work, it just took some creative mixing and matching of the arms provided to get the mount to sit 90 degrees to the mount.  I was able to mount the 4th arm and tuck it close in case I ever use it with another projector or a future homeowner needs it.  I think this would be expected for most universal mounts.  It worked though and that was the key.  The only other issue I had was the roll adjustment +\/- 15 degrees needs an external tooth lock washer to create increased bite into the metal.  I had to really tighten those two screws down to hold the offset weight of the projector in the adjustment angle I needed otherwise they would slide.  The instructions were a little vague in some places, but if you took the time you could figure it out if you have half a brain which I guess is in short supply nowadays from reading a few of the bad reviews."}

{"reviewerID":"A32LX4XJ2LU740","reviewText":"I had a really bad impression and rated this at one star within hours of have receive it. But things have changed.UPDATE 8\/25\/2012I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars because while the sound is pretty unimpressive in Bluetooth mode, its amazing when you plug in direct via the 3.5mm jack. Updating firmware to the latest version plus applying a new sound enhancement algorithm address all the issues I had brought up when I first played out of the box. The algorithm is called Sound Clarity and it fine-tunes the sound to minimize distortion at high volume levels. I am not referring to LiveAudio, which is pretty useless because it only works in Bluetooth mode. All-in-all..with everything updated, charged up, and with sounds algos enabled -- it sounds great and the form factor is perfect for my uses. Like many others, I am carrying it around house, playing my own music. It's a great alternative to wearing earbuds.I'm keeping it and highly recommend it. In fact I went to Target today and listened to the Soundfreq Soundkick which some reviewers(including iLounge) have touted as being vastly superior to the Jambox at half the price. I can tell you for sure, that I would have bought the Soundfreq and returned the the Jambox in a heartbeat if that was the case. It turned out that the Soundfreq is okay, but I think the sound is better and fuller on the Jambox, not to mention the fact that you can put the Jambox in your pocket.JAMBOX HONEYMOON UPDATE 8\/28\/2012 9:23 AMAs I've gained more experience listening to Jambox, I have become more and more aware of it's imperfections when playing at volume levels that are not necessarily loud, but what I would rather call enjoyable. As remarkable as the Jambox is for putting out big sounds from a small box, I'm increasingly finding that great music that sounds great on other speakers sounds muddled and distorted and Jambox. Is it possible to enjoy the Jambox?  Yes -- there is a way to tweak the volume to find the \"sweet spot\" volume so that you wind up with something acceptable.If you have Jambox you know what I'm talking about. But I find myself asking -- should I really have to do that with a $150+ speaker?That being said, I did some more research over the weekend and I \"rediscovered\" Soundmatters FoxL. Weeks ago, after doing all the research on the Jambox (including watching various YouTube videos) I had heard about the FoxL. But I dismissed it as a Jambox wannabe. I made my decision based on the fact that I had never head of \"Soundmatters\" before and that a reviewer on YouTube had compared the FoxL and Jambox side by side and said that the Jambox had better bass.But during my Jambox honeymoon as I noticed that while the bass on the Jambox is stunning -- it is often mangled. So I started looking for alternatives.The interesting thing is that, unlike Jambox's press reviews which are from techie reviewers and general consumer electronics, the FoxL reviewers tend more to be Audiophile magazines and high-end audio blogs. That got my attention, so on a whim, I ordered the thing and plan to compare the two when it comes. Will let you know!UPDATE 8\/29\/2012The Soundmatters FoxL arrived yesterday and I had the opportunity to listen to and compare it with the Jambox.Conclusions:-- The FoxL -- I'm just in love with it. After about 5 minutes quickly flipping the samples of music that the Jambox had trouble with, I realized that I could listen all my songs at normal enjoyable sound levels. It blows the Jambox away. Totally. No adjusting volume. Clear, sharp, tight bass and bigger and higher quality sound than should be come from a box that is even smaller than the Jambox. I think the sound engineers here (led by a NASA scientist) focused all their attention on driving pure, full bodied sound. I have no doubt that if Bose designed a tiny speaker like this -- it would be sort of be like the FoxL.- The Jambox is good. But I think Jawbone's technology people weighted the engineering team on giving it a brain, with updateable firmware and speech capabilities. That that's good in that, over time, it has allowed them to optimize and tweak the sound through firmware updates and different algorithms such as Sound Clariy and Live Audio. But the physical audio design has limitations that, are increasingly obvious as I listen a wide variety music ranging from Daft Punk, John Rutter, the Rippingtons, Return to Forever, to the Carpenters etc...over the past few days. Any thing that is bass heavy, I'd have to lower the volume to remove the distortion. On some songs that are not bass heavy such as Ocean Song by the Rippingtons, it sounded muddled and not as clear as I'd like...instrumentation sort mashed to together, not sounding distinct. No color. Sort of a big thud rather than a crisp bell. Early on, I rationalized that it's because is the Jambox is a very small, and that by the laws of physics it's not going to sound as a good as your big sound system. Still, it got annoying.I'm returning the Jambox and keeping the Soundmatters FoxL. I'm keeping my rating for the Jambox at 4 stars because it's still overall an amazing device. Many people love it. But I'm very picky when it comes to sound. But if you're a sound purist you may want to consider trying out the FoxL."}
{"reviewerID":"A1ABGTGJTCD6S9","reviewText":"I bought these essentially for in-home communication between floors of a home. For this use they work flawlessly. I have experimented a couple times using a unit indoors and the other unit outdoors and really only get about a half mile range in a level wooded rural area.They are primarily used for the 'call' alert button but the voice transmission works quite well, very clear.Cons: For older users with not so steady hands, the channel can easily be changed while attempting to use the Call button. This was a bit of an annoyance at first as any slip-up which changes the channel makes communication impossible because the channel of one unit has changed. It would be nice to have a 'Lock' mode but there isn't. My remedy was to tape a trimmed off q-tip shaft vertically next to the channel buttons which makes them more difficult to accidentally press down.As someone else has stated, you really need rechargables to use these. After much searching of reviews and prices I ended up getting 4 four packs of the Rayovac 4.0's and have been very happy with their length of charge. I already had a very modest quality 4 battery Rayovac charger (Model 33 I think) which charges them fine in about 3 hours. The batteries were very reasonable (I used Bedford Power). You'd be crazy not to buy them on-line from the prices I've seen in the discount stores.The size is really small which makes them easy to carry around and for older people with small\/weak hands to use............................................(update)I have found that by activating the 'receiving' unit's monitoring of ALL channels allows the pick up of channels which may have been changed inadvertently by the 'sending' unit. This probably eats up more battery power though."}

{"reviewerID":"A3BUZ84MXSA0CM","reviewText":"Bought this camera after owning a 4\/3 SLR.  I wanted something smaller but with good image quality (and faster focus).I'm no pro (I know the basics), but like to get high quality pictures with low effort.This camera produces very good results, exposure is always very good, with or without flash.Color balance also seems very good all the time.Flash is powerful enough and produces beautiful evenly lit pictures , I just wish it would self-release when needed.Focusing is fast enough for most situations, but haven't tried sports yet.The menus (specially the Q button quick menu) are easy to navigate.Haven't used the Wifi function yet.The kit lens does not make this camera pocketable, but you can get the 27mm fixed focal length for $199 and the camera fits on a coat pocket.  The 27mm provides a good FL for most situations.If you want to get a telephoto or wide angle, things get pretty expensive.I would like to get a telephoto but the cheapest one from Fujifilm is $399, which is pretty expensive for most non-pros (i.e. those of us who don't get paid to take pictures).  I hope it goes down in price like the 27mm pancake did :) or an alternative is released.Battery life is good for my use.Overall, I really like the camera.  It makes some compromises (no optical viewfinder, plastic body, no X-Trans sensor), but they are reasonable at this price point, and the extra features are available on other cameras in the X lineup (at an extra cost off course).I would give it 4,5 stars for the minor things outlined above, but I round up to 5."}

My motherboard actually does not support SATA III, so my EVO is actually bottlenecked a bit. TRIM and other such still works 100%, but reaching maximum speeds is impossible. However, this thing is still FAST! I actually notice it being faster than the 128GB Mushkin Chronos I've since relegated to a backup drive (for the crime of being too small), and that drive bottlenecked on my SATA II motherboard too. Windows 8 boots in just over half the time it takes my motherboard to drag itself through the POST and RAID (5, for my three 640GB WD Blues) readouts. Samsung software has an \"AHCI is disabled\" warning even though it is enabled (I am using RAID 5 on the same storage controller, and RAID does not work without AHCI). Installation was dead simple, and the software is completely optional albeit somewhat useful.Things to note:Write speed is not sustained, the EVOs use a buffer of super-fast memory to write to.When this buffer overflows you lose the advertised maximum and return to write speeds typical of the regular 840The 840 Pro is a superior product in terms of raw performance but you probably don't need an 840 Pro anywayIf you choose not to optimize with the Samsung software, move your pagefile off the SSD if you can help it as pagefiles cause SSD wear."}

{"reviewerID":"A3PX4P7CZIK5ZX","reviewText":"I've been carrying a New Trent battery pack in my backpack for almost two years now.  It has consistently, reliably charged my various devices - iPhone, iPad, keyboard, earbuds and MiFi have all gotten extra boosts of power from the battery pack.  It's getting a little worn out after two years of use, so I was on the hunt for another one.  Based on reviews and my positive experience with my current charger, I bought the New Trent PowerPak Xtreme NT120R external battery pack.I have to admit, the first thing I noticed when I picked up the box was not the battery pack itself, but the packaging.  The package has a flap, which normally would swing around and be generally annoying; this package, however, used two small magnets to hold the flap in place.  Nothing to do with the battery pack, but shows that New Trent is thinking about the details and consumer when they design things, even the packaging.The first thing I noticed when I pulled the battery pack out of the box was the weight - man, this thing is heavy for an external battery.  I carry my battery pack in a backpack, so it's not a big deal for me, but there's no way I'd carry this battery around in a pocket.  It reminds me of a tractor tread, not only in its color and design, but also in the way it just seems to be sitting on the counter and saying \"I dare you to try to hurt me.\"  It looks practically indestructible!I found the power button on the side and turned the battery pack on - four small, well-hidden blue LED lights showed me four levels of power.  I was about to wash the dishes, so I carried my phone and the battery pack into the kitchen and charged the phone while I listened to a podcast.  While I was washing dishes, I accidentally splashed the battery pack with water - the battery didn't skip a beat.  The packaging claims the battery pack is waterproof, so I figured I'd test it with my full sink.  I unplugged the battery pack and dunked it in the sink - still didn't skip a beat!  Not that I'd normally toss the battery into puddles or swimming pools, but it's nice to know if I get caught in the rain with my backpack the battery pack won't die.The battery pack comes with a USB cable, but no wall charger.  Not a problem - if you don't have an extra wall charger from a phone sitting around, New Trent's got you covered with the NT90C dual charger.  The only thing I find even mildly annoying about the battery pack is the amount of force required to open the door covering the USB slots on the bottom.  It doesn't quite make me feel like I'm ripping my fingernails off when I open the door, but it is a little uncomfortable.  I understand it's got to make a tight seal, and I appreciate the lid is probably designed to not wear out over time, so I can give this a pass.All in all, I love this battery pack.  I'm prone to dropping everything, as the scuffs and cracks on my current battery pack and phone case show.  It's so nice to have at least one thing in my pack that I can drop with no fear of breaking it."}

I saw some comments complaining about channel changing speed.  It does seem a little slow on response time, but it's not something I would pay more for, just to have faster channel switching.  It's a good bargain dorm\/bedroom\/extra TV, not something you want as your primary home theater."}

{"reviewerID":"A1ZSJN0GZ0182B","reviewText":"One problem with the way these 3rd party listings are done is that one seller can create a page and then another seller can jump on and list their product under the same listing, even if it isn't the same exact brand or quality. You also have the original creator of the page change the quality of their product at some point and leave it under the same listing. This is done for a variety of reasons, not all of which are nefarious.We buy a lot of different electronics for different businesses, so we have ordered many times from different sellers under the same listing. And since Amazon will not differentiate reviews based on the actual seller, we are going to try and collect reviews of items from specific sellers. If we ordered the item, we will note it. If we collect the information from another reviewer, we will note that as well. Lastly, we'll put the date of the purchase or posting of the original review. Hopefully this will help buyers under this listing determine the proper item AND seller to purchase.The star rating will go up or down based on how many good or bad products show up overall.Important Note: It is still possible that a seller may change their product at any time, even after a review is posted, so keep that in mind. You are most likely to receive the product matching the review if order one that is FULFILLED BY AMAZON. This is because sellers will generally send in large quantities to the Amazon warehouse at one time.------------2\/14 Seller: Cable-Mix - Ordered by us. Bulk packaging polybagged. 25FT. Gold Connectors. Appears to be 28AWG. Black Cable w\/ Black\/Striped Connectors. Had problems with highest resolutions..... This listing is a good example of another problem where a seller will list a high quality item to get the rating up, and then change the listing to a lower quality product. We have ordered from this listing many times before, and I would rate the quality of the cable as 5 Stars, Excellent. However, the last few orders we placed for this listing have been poor quality. It's such a huge difference that I'm surprised they would go that far down in grade. Also, this was a listing for 25FT HDMI cables for the longest time, but as of this review, it is for different lengths and quantities. Seeing as how all the original reviews were for 25FT cables of a certain grade, it's really rather underhanded to completely change it to something else. This seller was one of our top suppliers, on Amazon and elsewhere, but I doubt we will continue to order from them in the future. Beware this one."}

{"reviewerID":"A1CP110U11Q4BC","reviewText":"I bought this to replace a Logitech Harmony 890 which had been refurbished by Logitech. This Harmony 900 is new and factory fresh (not refurbished), and I expected it to be problem-free. After 5 or 6 months of using the 900, I am convinced it is probably better than the 890 was, but the 900 has a few problems, too. I like the on-line programming Logitech has for the Harmony remotes. You can find just about any device that can be operated with either a RF (radio frequency) or IR (infra-red) remote controller. You can set up your cable box, digital video recorder, A\/V receiver, TV, Blu-ray Internet, and X-10 light controller, as I have, plus about anything else you might want to add. Both the 890 and the 900 offer RF control, while most of the other Harmony remotes offer only IR. My major complaint is about the battery charging system. The control will freeze if the battery is charged too much! You can't keep the Harmony in the battery charging saddle, and the power to the battery charger can not be turned off or controlled with a timer. Still, I couldn't find another controller which does as much as the Logitech Harmony 900 (or the 890) does. I just don't have 100% confidence in it being able to work properly tomorrow. Logitech does provide good tech support on the phone for a year or so, but I wish the Harmony was more dependable. I would recommend this only to someone who won't get too upset with an occasional need to push the Help button on the remote."}

{"reviewerID":"AL5CUWBFBMWYQ","reviewText":"If you spend some time reading AVSForums you'll learn that last years model (the 3310) was plagued with dead networking cards.  It appears that nothing has changed with there year's model.  I ordered the 3311 from 6th Ave and they were quick to ship with a good price but after hooking it up I realized my network card was busted.  The unit will hang in the \"Network Connecting\" screen and never acquire an IP address or permit you to manually change any of the network settings.  Again, searching thru AVSForums I learned that this was a common problem on the 3310 and a few folks have had this with the 3311.  Since the networking features are the primary reason to step up to the 3311 from the 2311, this is a deal breaker.  I contacted 6th Ave and so far they have been great about the return.I'm on the fence on whether to try another Denon or try a Pioneer.  After my issues, I read up and realized that the Denons have a serious issue with reliability in terms of the network card.  Sure they offer a 3 year warranty, but you'll be without your receiver for weeks and have to pay to ship something that weighs 40lbs across the USA.  I have the 2310 now, and it's been a reliable receiver but I needed to upgrade to get 3D support.  I upgraded one model to get Pandora support and what I thought was digital source support for Zone 2.  After having the unit I now discover that Zone2 digital source support only means via Optical\/Coax and not HDMI.  I can't believe that HDMI sources are still not supported for Zone 2.  I like to use Zone 2 to play my outdoor speakers and I refuse to run analog cables to all my sources for this.  It's just absurd that a receiver of this caliber with all the HDMI features you can imagine has left this out.Pros:- Video switching is good (no better or worse than last years model)- 3D pass thru from DirecTV to Panasonic VT25 works fine. (this would not work on the 2310 and DirecTV would fail to tune the 3D channels because if it)- HD Radio is nice, this was my first experience with HD radio and it truly is great stuff.  All the FM radio stations around me have HD support of it's great qualityCons:- Broken Network kills much of the things I bought it for.  How a $1300 receiver can ship with such crappy quality control amazes me.- Lack of Zone2\/3 audio support from HDMI inputs.  This kills me.- Interface and manual still suck (IMO).  I think you realize more how bad it is when you have a defective unit and there's no useful troubleshooting.  No customer service support on the weekends either.- Charging $50 for Airplay support is pathetic, they should provide this firmware update for free.Still on the fence, since this receiver is one of the few I can find that does what I want.  I may end up trying another one but now I'm concerned about the reliability and just annoyed with Denon's poor quality control in regards to these networked receivers."}

She's using it with her regular Kindle (not Paperwhite) and it fits quite nicely.  The Kindle is held in place by elastic straps and, combined with the gray textured lining, feels fairly secure.  Also, because of this design, it's a universal case that I imagine could work with other tablets or e-readers of a similar size to a Kindle or Kindle Paperwhite.  This open-sided design also allow for easy access to the charging port and power switch.The version I got for my wife has a black leatherette cover with Snoopy on his doghouse and the design, while cute, looks almost like an embossed heat transfer. It looks great, but we both worry about how durable it will be; it looks like it would be easy to chip off when thrown into a bookbag or purse.  However, because this hasn't happened yet, it's more of a warning than a reason to deduct a star.Overall, while I feel this case seems a little pricey compared to other options, my wife feels it's worth every penny!  But there's one thing we agree on, and that is this is a fantastic case for any Peanuts\/Snoopy lover!"}
{"reviewerID":"AE2X30STEHHY8","reviewText":"In this package, you get a pair of headhphones and earphones. For the price, of under $10, it is a pretty good deal, considering they could sell the headphones, at the same quality, for the same price alone. However, I do have a few gripes about the thing as a whole...First, is the earbuds. They are horrible. Coby makes a similar model for $4, which are much superior in just about every way. These are much too quiet, the sound quality is horrible, and they just feel too cheap. They do however, come in a nice case that would hold the alternative earbuds, as well as an extra pair of rubber thingies. I wouldn't buy these earbuds over the other Coby model if they were $1.Now, the Headphones. The sound is superb, except for the fact that when I put the volume on full blast, the left ear had an annoying buzz that was impossible to block out. With the sound on lower volume, these headphones are more than decent sound quality. The build quality however, is a different story. They are flimsy as can be. The folding technique would break them if you tried to fold them, then unfold them, and it eventually did break without me ever doing so. They are merely cheap plastic, and break with the slightest stretch, which is sometimes necessary to even put them on.If you plan on buying one of these bundles every few weeks to few months, then these are for you. If not, go with a higher quality Headphone, and Coby's alternative earphones."}
{"reviewerID":"A28LXIZQOEQ6KY","reviewText":"I was tired of my Olympus XA rangefinder film camera getting stuck so that the film would not advance and the shutter would not fire. I have used it for a long while and really enjoyed a \"small shooter\" I could pop out at any time and snap a quick candid. This camera is not as unobtrusive as the XA because it has no viewfinder (only the screen) meaning I have to stand there with my arms out staring at the screen and looking a lot more conspicuous. I also lost the three-point stabilization of two hands + face that helped hold the camera steady.Having said all that, I am very glad I bought this. The photo quality is nice ISO 200 or lower and reasonable up to 400. Compared to a film camera not so good but to other digitals in the same genre I find that it excels. The menu system is so intuitive as to make the manual unneeded for standard shooting (read it anyway -- there are a lot of amazing features available).The Leica-branded optics are excellent... I have seen very little flair, almost no falloff or vignetting, and no CA (at low ISO). The camera gets noisy quick at 400 and images shot at 800 or higher are not usable unless you just want something to prove you took a picture. This was never my requirement and my intent is to use this camera until a decent, pocket-able DSLR becomes available and affordable (Micro Four Thirds, I would guess, but even the current generation is not quite ready for prime time) or until I am willing to spring for a Leica D-Lux or something comparable.In the meantime, I find this camera a ready and able street-shooter. The biggest pluses I can mention are:--Rapid shutter. You push, it shoots. Push again, it shoots again. The shutter release is VERY responsive, one of the biggest problems with most compact digitals.--Flash is a fill flash. No harsh shadows.--Image Stabilization. Compensates for the hand shake with a compact.--Small, light, and unobtrusive. Fits nicely in a shirt pocket or a cell-style belt pouch.--Extremely well designed and intuitive menu system--Full manual control over exposure and aperture with an excellent TTL meter. This is rarely available on a compact and makes the term \"point and shoot\" invalid when applied to this camera, though it can be used that way.--Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority modes, as well as Program AE.--Extremely accurate auto-focus--Auto-focus is FAST--Depth of field is displayed right on the screen (e.g. 1.5f to 35ft)--Auto-focus is easily adjusted shot-by-shot if desired...just touch the AF point on the screen--Extra wide-angle lens perfect for landscapes and large groups.--Optical zoom with the ability to completely disable so-called \"digital zoom\". In fact, it was disabled by default on my unit.--Battery life is so long as to obviate the need for a spare (but I still have one). I shoot for 10 days or so without recharging and the battery has never been dead yet. Caveat: I almost never use a flash.--JPEG engine seems to produce high quality files that are not overly large despite the high megapixel countCons:--It is a compact digital, no viewfinder--So-so image quality at ISO 400, noisy at 800 and useless at 1600. These are not a concern for me. The image stabilization has allowed me to shoot at the lower ISO speeds with a slower shutter speed and not see any motion blur (or only background subject motion, not camera shake).Overall, I find this to be an outstanding camera compared with ANY compact digital. I highly recommend this camera."}

I use the wall charger, but it comes with car charger too.  Great product."}

{"reviewerID":"A28AOYX0UWTI66","reviewText":"Great price for a very useful product. My experience with this product is that all the aperture openings do line up with everything on Asus.It says it is made of &#34;leather&#34; but I think it is more plasticky than leathery...but either way it is protective. Leather would have lasted longer than plastic material but for the price, I am not going to complain.Note that with the keyboard attached, the Asus Transformer is way heavier than a netbook. But that is not the fault of this cover.  Both black and brown are quite good looking.Highly recommend this product."}
{"reviewerID":"A2RWNWPONC8BD9","reviewText":"I've had this TV a couple of days and so far I'm pleased with my purchase. I bought it new from amazon for about $190 and you can't beat that price for any 40\" LCD TV. The picture quality is I'd say a 6 out of 10 in my eyes. Aside from the backlight and contrast there's very few controls to tweak the colors, although the image presets are fine for most uses. The sound is obviously sub-par and has very little base but it does have some volume, and it doesn't distort when turned all the way up. The Remote though, is the worst one I've ever seen on a device, because even though it works and it looks OK, the individual keys stick. One thing that scared me a little bit is that when I went to pick it up at my local UPS location (I missed the original delivery) the box was split in half as if the bottom was never attached. I had to take the TV out of the box at the UPS building because it could not be carried in the bottom half of the box. I inspected of course the TV for physical damage and it looked fine, but I think I got lucky. If you're looking for a cheap TV, this is in line with most $400 TV sets you can find on Walmart or Best Buy. Hopefully, I won't have to use the 2 year warranty, because I honestly don't think it's worth the hassle returning it."}

I love the flexibility and easy management of the settings (once you learn the menus of course-- hey, if you want simple point and shoot controls-- don't buy this camera). It is a fine backup and walkaround camera for the DSLR user who didn't want to lug the big camera around that day. I'm happy with it."}

It seems like I get about 90-120 minutes of battery, which is much worse than the stock battery, but much better than NO battery."}
{"reviewerID":"A2EDTVVR9IFNLW","reviewText":"I've got this in my Samsung HMX-F90 Camcorder. I can record 499 minutes of video on it, so that's the practical on the size spec.Transfers quickly enough when inserted into the card slot on my laptop, but my computer heritage includes loading things from cassette tapes to a Commodore 64. If you don't have to start it loading when you get home from school, and go eat a snack, then come back and wait through Jeopardy for it to load, I'm good with it.Of course, the Samsung SD card is much faster than that--7 video files and 15 pictures from my daughter's choir program transferred off the card and onto the PC while I checked my email last night, so under 30 seconds for 15 minutes of video and 15 pics. That works.Durability is, of course, a question, but so far it's holding up well. No data loss. It is a &#34;Class 6&#34; and some devices really prefer a &#34;Class 10,&#34; but if you don't need the higher speed, this is a great way to shave a dollar or two off the cost."}

{"reviewerID":"ADKPCPJ5WMOVS","reviewText":"First off, let me say that I bought this in a pinch, at walmart.Hello, Welcome to a rant, by me. This Router... I'll start with the positives. It's cheap, great, wonderful.It does do exactly what I need to do, which is wireless cast a signal, awesome.It even has relatively simple Port forwarding, which is a huge bonus in my opinion.I'm glad the software at least doesn't suck.Now, let's talk about why I hate it, and why it's making me want to rip my teeth out.Every thirty minutes, without fail, it disconnects, and sends intermittent signals. Enjoying a game of League of Legends? Not anymore you aren't.With these disconnects, requires a reset, whereas it will be all hunky dory again. Until it realises it's still a piece of s***, and kills itself.I have factory reset it, tried to give it a firmware update (Belkins support site sucks absolute ass), found out it has the most up to date firmware.I cannot express in words how ungodly annoying it is to have to continuously reset this thing.It will be going into the trash, forgotten and hated. I have never in my years of using routers have had such a bad one.Thank you Belkin, for proving to me that they exist. I'm going back to Netgear, and never leaving."}
{"reviewerID":"AVFU8PFSA1FDT","reviewText":"I have had this and have been using this model for about 6 months.  It is a decent router while it is working, but each time there is a power interruption, no matter how brief, I almost always have to reboot it and then some of the connections with it.  If you live in an area with a poor power source like I do, this is not the model for you or plan on connecting it to a UPS.Only other problem I have had with it was making the connection to my WiFi radios.  For some reason it did not want to recognize them and on re-boot it sometimes takes awhile for the connection to work.  This is happening on a variety of brands and may not be a router problem but my Internet provider.  Comcast says it is not their problem ...Works well with several devices running at the same time."}
{"reviewerID":"A2XR7G6J6O7NOG","reviewText":"This is a pretty good product for about 10 bucks. It meets my basic needs to have a portable keyboard and turns my tablet pc (Exopc) into a mini portable work station whenever I want to get some serious work done.  The material used for the keyboard is just very basic plastic but hey what do you expect for 10 bucks. The keyboard size is perfect and measures about 11.5\" x 5.25\" x 0.5\". Goes nicely with my 11.6\" slate.The one issue I have with the keyboard is that the Fn key and the Ctrl key are reversed from my Sony Vaio and so this tends to confuse me every now and then so I knocked off one star.  But for the price, I am happy."}

{"reviewerID":"AUEM2IURA4WN9","reviewText":"The construction of the bracket is generally sturdy. The metal is thick, and so is the rubber grip. The hot shoe mounts are attached by three rivets each. There is no flex when the camcorder\/camera is mounted. The screw is aluminum with a plastic knob, and it's the knob that worries me. However, it hasn't broken yet. The bottom of the screw is drilled and tapped to accept a standard camera screw.From other reviews, I gather this item compares favorably to similar lost cost brackets from other brands, though I have no first-hand experience to confirm.CON: The bracket doesn't give you enough space to flip open a 3' screen fully. That's why I'm giving it only four stars. What you can do is buy two brackets, cut off the bottom part of one piece to use as an extension. If you have access to a machine shop, you can use a tap to thread a hole, and use the (now extra) screw to connect the bracket to the extension. Some minor issues include the strong rubber smell when fresh from the package (goes away after a day); and the package box, which has the graphics for some other product. But a cardboard box is just a cardboard box.Manufacturer: if you'd just make the bottom horizontal bar longer by two inches, you'd make this bracket more attractive to  many of your customers. 3' screens are quite common."}
{"reviewerID":"A2BO04S6R2HKVK","reviewText":"Updating my original review since receiving my new copy of the lens.  For those wondering, my review has jumped from 1 Star to 4.  This piece of glass is THAT nice. I spent two days putting this lens through the ringer shooting stills and video of a group golf outing, rehearsal\/dinner, and the wedding the following day.  Shot the majority of the images between 4.0 and 8.0 - anything larger was overexposed in the bright sun. The low light images shot between 1.4 and 2.8 are beautiful, some softness in the corners but I tend to shoot portraits with my primes at wide apertures and very rarely are those faces in the corners!For the major focus issue I had in the first lens I received, the focus on this lens is fast and accurate.  In fact, I would say the focus is more accurate than my Canon 50mm 1.4 (which, btw, I may not ever use again until I buy a full frame camera).So in summary, I will leave my original review below because it is a significant issue that consumers should be aware of but the new lens I received is so incredible I felt the need to edit my review.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Labored over whether I should buy this Sigma 30mm or the Canon 28mm 1.8 for weeks. Ultimately decided to ignore the negative reviews questioning Sigma's quality control.  I wish I had listened. The AF on the lens does not function at all. Not front or back focusing, just NOT focusing. I mean, c'mon, how does that lens ever get shipped from the factory like that?This is all compounded by the fact that the box has some wear and tear. I must not be the first to open and return this item. You're better than this, Amazon."}

Better off just spending the money and getting a real quality laptop backpack.Hey the bag does look nice and compact, but now I prefer functionality over garbage."}
{"reviewerID":"A3L03V5P6K2Q1T","reviewText":"I am not using this case at all and will probably resell it.  I cannot figure out how to get the unit into the case when attached to the keyboard, and I also cannot dock the keyboard when I put them into the case separately.  I cannot reconnect them while they are in the case.  Was afraid I was going to break the dock if I forced it any harder so gave up.  I mostly use my T100 with the keyboard so that was a complete disappointment to me. The fit on the tablet is also not very good as others have mentioned.  It gaps and then does not line up with the camera and light sensor.  It is like it is just a tiny bit too small or too big - not sure which. This might work okay for some people if they mostly use it as a tablet, but I think there must be something better out there for those of us who use their Transformer docked to the keyboard most of the time."}
