They HAVE to be the best in their class....about $600 the pair.....but typical planars....small imaging.....4 ohm power hungry.....sound slightly strained.....4 or 5 Feet out from the wall.....but still....I wanted more.I bought a set of ElectroMotion ESLs from Amazon. I power them with a 35 YO Receiver, the NAD 7175. It is so good, it is scary accurate.If you buy a Small stereo system, it sounds like you have a small sound coming out of a small box......If you buy Better tower Speakers.....it might sound like you are setting at a concert on the 50th row of a 100 row theater.If you buy some very, very good box speakers.....it might move you down to the first rows......And it might not.But if you buy really well made and balanced ElectroStatics, like these MartinLogans....the artists are in your living room.You can hear them breathing.......Some say the Bass is thin. Don't believe them. Unless you are a devotee of \"Ace of Bass\" music....the bass is Full and accurate.They are going to break in and get better........ :)These are fabulous speakers.BEST in class."}

But I didn't and both me and my wife weer pleasantly amazed at the ease of use and high quality pictures we got immediately. I suspect people play with the settings and especially the high iso one and end of with less resolution for low light which may not be needed anyway. The auto function works extemely well as it select the best scene, focus and shutter. All our initial pictures were just perfect, even under less than idea conditions. For my book I give it an overall 4.5, and that is just because the camera is still new and still learning the full features, I would recommencd it as others have. None were blurred."}
