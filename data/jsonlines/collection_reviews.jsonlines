{"reviewerID":"AO94DHGC771SJ","reviewText":"We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!, New Trent really made my life alot easier! I carry the iTorch with me EVERYWHERE! All the time! It's small enough to fit in my pocket and it really makes my life easier! It has a built in red laser and a led white flashlight built in. I play with those but haven't \"used\" them yet. The charger keeps my phone or tablet charged all day long for a few days! I never have to worry about finding a place to charge my phone, it's always charged. My car cigarette lighter plugs are in use for a flashlight and my gps and my kids stuff and I always need a place to plug my phone into... not anymore! I never have to worry about a low battery with this charger! When I have my Tablet and Phone or if my husband is with me I use the bigger New Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Dual USB Ports External Battery Pack. It has 2 charging ports so we are both charged at all times! We go to breakfast every weekend - our \"get away\" from the kids... \"OUR\" time! I never have to worry about running out of battery ever again! 10 stars at the very least! For both of these products!, My husband is a long haul trucker, well you know - they gotta have tunes to keep them going on those long nights.  Anyway he bought an awesome 12&#34; box with two subs... he put it under his bunk and I told him I didn't like the way it was just open there, I told him I'd be scared to death of poking a hole in one of the subs.  We ordered these R\/T 12&#34; steel Waffle Speaker Grills and a week later when he returned home he put them on.  Funny cuz that week he was gone he almost had a heart attack when he threw his pop bottle in back forgetting about his speaker box and the bottle landed just shy of the subs... These grills are more then worth the price, have already done their job in a week to save our subs.  There not flimsy like I kinda worried about, and will protect your speakers very well unless you just wanted to go up to them and kick the tar out of them.  They came in a plastic envelope not protected very good but not a scratch on them, they were here in just a few days and I was very impressed with the shipping time from the time I ordered them to when they were shipped out and again when we received them.  Absolutely an A+ on this one!, I bought this battery pack for my droid and my Kindle Fire. I take it EVERYWHERE I go when I bring more then one device. My husband and I use this continuously! It seems we are always on our phones and tablets. NO MORE running out of battery! No more scrambling to find a plug in so my phone isn't dead for my kids to get ahold of me. I am always charged up now! If I could give this more then 5 stars I would. It deserves way more! Comes with a nice fabric case to carry it in. I will NEVER be without this one if I have more then one device with me. If I only have one... I got the smaller version which is the New Trent iTorch. New Trent makes some amazing products and if your on the go and find yourself always plugging your phone in - in the car or wherever - this is the product for you! Don't worry about not having a full battery ever again!, I have my big Canon that I just don't wanna drag around with me all the time, I bought this camera just to throw in my purse and go... It's small, lightweight and takes amazing pictures for a small camera.  I take it everywhere with me, to the park, lake ect and don't worry about damaging it.  Very inexpensive for what it is but well worth it!  I love the Canon so much more because it has it's own battery and it lasts 1000 times longer then the camera's with the double A batteries, this battery lasts me a whole few days using it almost all day.  I haven't bought a 2nd battery yet and really don't see a reason to have one.  The Canon rechargeable batteries sure do hold up and I am very impressed!  It's a gotta have camera for the kids, for the enthusiast, for anyone really, like I said, the price is great, the camera takes very impressive pictures and it's so much more lighter weight than my $1200.00 I usually took everywhere with me and it takes pictures that come out as good as my big camera!, Very nice case... I couldn't find one I really liked or wanted but this was next in line... Protects my fire very well and it's a very nice case, I was disappointed that I couldn't find what I wanted... I was hoping to have some kind of strap to keep it closed and the strap on the case seems to be more for decoration - it does work to keep it closed but just doesn't seem to be that is what it's made for.  It is a really nice case and I would totally recommend it to anyone - just wasn't what I really wanted otherwise it would of gotten 5 stars., Love the Power Xtreme! Received mine last week and have had a few chances to use it now... it reminds me of a turtle shell, I have a few more of New Trent's battery packs but this one I trust my husband with!  He is out in the elements and dust & whatnot... this powerpak took his Galaxy S4 from 1% battery to about half in no time.  He is a truck driver and ALWAYS on the phone!  With this powerpak it can sit in his pocket with a cord long enough to reach his phone up to his ear or on it's holster and give it a good quick charge no matter what he's doing.  I love the fact that it's so protected.  It opens up on the bottom to plug it in, and the on off switch is just as protected under the shell of the case. And believe me when I tell you it's easy to clean dirt, grease and whatever off of this turtle shell case!  This power pak is a MUST for anyone out in the elements or anyone that gets dirty,  greasy and grimy that needs to keep control over his\/her phone - tablet -computer ect!  With this powerpak you are totally in a win win situation!"}
{"reviewerID":"AMO214LNFCEI4","reviewText":"I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips., Using this cable to connect HiSense Sero Lite and Sero Pro to TV; works great!  My only regret is that I should have got 2 of these cables., The blurb says \"great for charging iPhones, iPods, GPS...\"  NOT!!!! Do not buy this!!  I would have given it ZERO stars but Amazon won't let me.  Even though it has a 3 amp fuse the converter only allows it to supply each port with .5 amp, not enough to charge any modern USB devices which all require 1 amp.  It will NOT power my TomTom GPS, my Samsung phone, my Phillips MP3 player, my LG phone, or anything else I have plugged into it.  I threw it in the trash.  Other reviews told me this in advance, but the blurb said otherwise and I believed the blurb.  I will not be buying any further products from this seller because of the deceptive advertising.  I'm still looking for a 4 port USB charger, darn it., It's OK.  Wish it could stand up in either portrait or landscape mode without falling over, but for the price it is better than nothing., The case is OK for the price, considering how difficult it is to find a cover for this tablet. The tablet can barely stand up by itself in landscape mode, and cannot be stood up in portrait mode.  The slightest bump will knock it over, so it requires two hands to use it.  Still looking for the perfect case.  Something that snaps onto the back making a lower profile product would be nice."}
